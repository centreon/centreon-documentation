## Centreon MAP 20.10.0

Released October, 21 2020.

**New features**

The license system is entirely managed on the central server Centreon, there is no more this on the Map Server side.

This release is focused on the creation of a new Centreon MAP server (code name **"NG"** for new generation).This one was thought to be more powerful, faster & lighter.

To allow the evolution of this server, it is in **experimental phase** for customers wishing to activate it because it is not installed by default.


On the Web side, everything is adapted, a new input field has appeared in the module parameters to enter the new IP of the Map NG server, and a choice button allows to switch from one to the other.

  - Administration \> Extensions \> Manager

 > **Attention**: the entire NG environment is read-only. To allow you to progressively > increment the evolutions according to user feedback.
