## Create a GeoView

A user that is a Centreon admin, or a Centreon Map admin or has right to
create view can create geographic views using the web interface, to do
so:

1. Go to `Monitoring > Map` and click on the "+" on the Geographic section.
2. You're asked to give a name to the view and then to define resources to
   display on the view.
3. After configuring these parameters, resources will appear on this
   geographic view

The following resources can be displayed on a GeoView:

- Hosts belonging to hostgroup(s)
- Business Activity belonging to Business View(s)
- One or multiple Hostgroup(s)

Pre-requisites: Define lat/long coordinate in the resources configuration form
for host, hostgroups or business activity.

Example with a host:

## How access control limitation (ACL) are handled

As soon as you give access to `Monitoring > Map` or to a custom view
containing a Map widdget, GeoViews are accessible to every Centreon
user. A user will only see resources he is authorized to see, based on
his ACL profile.

## How resources are displayed

When a resource (host, hostgroup or a business activity) is positionned
on a geoview, it's displayed as a circle which colored is defined using
the following rules:

- Host: worst state between the host and its services
- Hostgroups: worst state of hosts belonging to the hostgroups
- Business activity: current status

*Worst state order: Critical (red) \> Down (red) \> Warning(orange) \>
Unknown(gray) \> Unreachable(gray) \> Ok(green) \> Up(green) \> Pending(blue)*

### Clustering

When multiple resources are geographically close and you are at
"certain" zoom level, then they're grouped into one single circle
displaying two things:

- Status of the worst object (displayed as a color between green, orange, red
  and gray)
- Number of resources in this state

*This behavior can be disabled in the global Centreon Map parameters*

### Blinking resources

If a resources is in a "not-ok" state, it blinks.

*This behavior can be disabled in the global Centreon Map parameters*

## Datalayers on Geoview

Centreon MAP gives you the possibility to display additionnal "data layers" on
maps to add context to your real time IT infrastructure status.

First you need to add data layers in Centreon Map option, then, if the
data layer is enabled, you may make it visible or not by checking the
concerned layer using the top left icon.
