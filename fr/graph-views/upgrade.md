title: Upgrade the extension
---

This chapter describes how to upgrade your Centreon MAP extension. This is done
by upgrading the three main components:

  - Centreon MAP server
  - Centreon MAP web interface & its widget
  - Desktop client (automatically updated).

Before upgrading Centreon MAP server, we highly recommand performing a MySQL
dump (backup) of your `centreon_studio` database. This will allow you easily to
roll back to the previous state if necessary.

Be sure to read the release notes for an explanation of features, fixes & custom
procedures.

**If you're updating to a new major or minor version (i.e:A.B.x with A or B that
changes) you need to contact our Support service to retrieve the new
repository**

## Centreon MAP Server

> If you are still running version **4.0.X**, you **must first install and run
> the server in version 4.1.X before upgrading to the latest version**.

Run the following commands to upgrade your Centreon MAP server:

``` shell
# systemctl stop tomcat
# yum update centreon-map-server
# systemctl start tomcat
```

## Centreon MAP Web interface

``` shell
yum update centreon-map-web-client
```

Complete the upgrade by going to *Administration \> Extensions \> Manager*
(module & widget parts):

## Centreon MAP Desktop client

If the user's computer has an online connection, the desktop client is
automatically upgraded to the latest version that corresponds to the server.
Alternatively, the client can be downloaded through this link: *Monitoring \>
Map | Desktop client*.
