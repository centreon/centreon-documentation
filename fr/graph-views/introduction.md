Centreon MAP is a data-mapping and visualization tool designed for IT Operations
management (ITOM) administrators and developers. It is capable of displaying
efficient graphic insights and mapping correlated data in customized
user-relevant views.

Create logical views using the Desktop client...

...and visualize them directly in your browser.

Or use the geographical view to display resources in the way your IT is spread
over a city, country or world.

Both types of views may be displayed in the same Centreon web user interface:

  - Either from the Centreon MAP dedicated user interface, which also includes a
    search facility
  - Or within a Custom View, using the dedicated Centreon MAP widget
