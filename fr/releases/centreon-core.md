*Released April, 22 2020*

> Known issues:
>
> - When upgrading to 20.04.0 (in both cases, restart `gorgoned` service after
>   any configuration changes):
>   - Some users can encounter connectivity issues between Gorgone and databases
>     on Central or Remote server due to wrong password in configuration. To
>     manage that, edit the `/etc/centreon/config.d/10-database.yaml` file and
>     validate that the database password is correct and surrounded by double
>     quotes,
>   - Some users can encounter problems when submitting monitoring actions from
>     web interface without any effect for Central poller. This might be due
>     to a wrongly set `command_file` directive of the `engine` module defined
>     in the `/etc/centreon-gorgone/config.d/40-gorgoned.yaml` configuration
>     file. To manage that, edit the file and change the path to match Engine
>     command file.
