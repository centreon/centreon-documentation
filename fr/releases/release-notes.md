### Centreon Web 18.10.0

#### New features

Centreon Remote Server is a new building-block in the Centreon distributed
monitoring architecture. It comes in addition to the existing Centreon Central
Server and Centreon Pollers.

Centreon Remote Server allows remote IT operations team to benefit from the full
Centreon user experience, albeit on a subset of Centreon Pollers. Monitoring
configuration takes place on the Central Server and is automatically
synchronized with all Remote Servers. Monitoring Operations (Acknowledge,
Downtime...) may take place both on a Remote Server or the Central Server.

In case of network link failure between a Remote Server and the Central Server,
data retention takes place and the two Servers are synchronized as soon as the
connection is up again.

Centreon Remote Server is integrated in Centreon Core. It fully replaces the
Poller Display module.

#### UI & UX Design

  - Add new banner system and UX
  - Add new menus system and UX
  - Unique format of dates displayed according to user language settings
  - Thanks to the community, Centreon is now available in Spanish and Portuguese
    (Portugal & Brazil)

Notice: The "Home \> Poller Statistics" menu moved to "Administration \> Server
Status". Moreover, this one is now named "Platform Status".

##### Fix of an encoding problem

Following a change of encoding tables in centreon database which occurred in the
2.7.0 version, bad encoded characters appear in the Centreon web interface.
Indeed, the change charset "latin1" to "utf8" was not followed by an update of
the content of tables in the database.

To restore a valid encoding of special and accented characters, it is necessary
to manually run the script provided by Centreon.

##### Warning

This script should be run once and only once.

If an operator has modified/corrected special characters or accented since the
2.7.0 update, processing performed by the script will truncate the string to
turn on the first special or accented character. It will then be necessary to
change the impacted objects to manually update them. (The script can
unfortunately provide the list of impacted objects.

All contents of table type "varchar", "char" or "text" will be updated

##### Prerequisites

Don't forget to backup your database before doing any operations.

##### Installation

Download and install the script in "/usr/share/centreon/bin/" with the command:

wget <http://resources.centreon.com/upgrade-2.6-to-2.7/migrate_utf8.php> -O
/usr/share/centreon/bin/migrate\_utf8.php

##### Execution

From a shell terminal, perform the script:

php /usr/share/centreon/bin/migrate\_utf8.php

##### Validation

Connect to your web interface and check that there are no more bad encoded
characters on it.

    state database (centreon\_storage) : added id and deletion of alias, url,

    in order to avoid problems.

#### Known Bugs

  - ACL of pages is not fully updated during the upgrade process. So please
    check all your ACL pages after the migration. You may have problems with the
    followings pages:

    - Monitoring \> Hosts
    - Monitoring \> Services
    - Monitoring \> Performances (new page)
    - Monitoring \> Downtimes
    - Monitoring \> Comments
    - Monitoring \> Eventlogs \> System logs

  - Graph slip not working

  - Pagination is broker when you go on the last page, change the number of line
    to the Max. Page become empty.

  - If you have timeperiods used in exception or inclusion of timeperiod and now
    deleted, their ids stays in the database in relation table. During the sql
    update process, this blocks an addition of constraint on this relation
    table. To fix it, you have to remove old timeperiod id.:
    
        mysql> DELETE FROM timeperiod_exclude_relations WHERE timeperiod_id NOT IN (SELECT tp_id FROM timeperiod) OR timeperiod_exclude_id NOT IN (SELECT tp_id FROM timeperiod);
        mysql> DELETE FROM timeperiod_include_relations WHERE timeperiod_id NOT IN (SELECT tp_id FROM timeperiod) OR timeperiod_exclude_id NOT IN (SELECT tp_id FROM timeperiod);

#### How to Install ?

Now that you are aware about all specificities of this version, you can install
it. If you install from zero your system, please follow the `installation guide
<install>`. Else you can refer to the `upgrade guide <upgrade>`. Take care about

### Centreon 2.4.1

#### Important notes

##### Connectors

If you are already using the *Centreon Connectors*, please note that the
connector path is no longer called with user variable *$USER3$*. It is instead
in the `Configuration` \> `Centreon` \> `Pollers` \> `Centreon Connector path`.
In that regard, be sure to fill this field and update the connector command line
in `Configuration` \> `Commands` \> `Connectors` by removing the *$USER3$*
prefix.

i.e:

    $USER3$/centreon_connector_perl

should become:

    centreon_connector_perl

Once you're done with updating those configurations, you may delete the former
*$USER3$* as it will be no longer used.

### Centreon 2.4

#### What's new?

##### Better integration with Centreon Engine and Centreon Broker

The `installation <centreon_install>` process has been reviewed: it is now
possible to specify the monitoring engine (Centreon Engine or Nagios) and the
event broker module (Centreon Broker or NDOUtils). All you need to do right
after a fresh installation is export your configuration files, then reload your
monitoring engine and the monitoring system should be up and running\!

This version offers the possibility to define the `connectors
<centreon-engine:obj_def_connector>` for Centreon Engine. Obviously, you do not
need to configure these connectors if you are still using Nagios.

It's been said that Centreon Broker can be cumbersome to configure, especially
if you are not familiar with its functioning. Centreon 2.4 offers a
configuration wizard now\!

##### Custom views

This new page enables users to make their own views with various widgets and
they are able to share their custom views with their colleagues\!

See the `user guide <widgets_user_guide>` to learn more about this feature.

##### Support for multiple LDAP servers

The LDAP authentication system is much more robust than before. Indeed, it is
now possible to have `multiple LDAP configurations <ldapconfiguration>` on top
of the failover system. The LDAP import form will let you choose the LDAP server
to import from.

Make sure that all your LDAP parameters are correctly imported after an upgrade.

##### New *autologin* mechanism

A better `autologin <autologin>` mechanism has been introduced in this version.
Now using randomly generated keys, it allows you to access specific pages
without being prompted for a username and a password.

##### Database indexes verification tool

If you upgrade from an old version of Centreon, now you can `check the
existence of all database indexes <synchronizing-indexes>` to ensure maximum
performance

#### Important notes

##### Administration

##### Communication with pollers

The default system user used by *Centcore* to communicate with pollers has
changed from `nagios` to `centreon`.

##### Plugins

For better performances, we advise you to use `check_icmp` instead of
`check_ping` if you are in an IPv4 network, that is (check\_icmp is not yet
compatible with IPv6). Switching from `check_ping` to `check_icmp` should be
quite simple as the plugins take the same parameters. All you have to do is
change the check commands: `check_centreon_ping`, `check_host_alive` and all the
commands that call `check_ping`.

#### Web interface

##### Autologin

A `new autologin mechanism <autologin>` has been added in Centreon 2.4. More
secured than the previous one, it will soon replace it. If you currently use
this feature, we recommend upgrading to the new one as soon as you can.

##### Centreon Broker init script

If you are using *Centreon Broker*, make sure to fill the *Start script for
broker daemon* parameter in `Administration` \> `Options` \> `Monitoring`. RRD
graphs cannot be rebuilt if this parameter is omitted\!

##### Centcore options

Two parameters have been added into the `Administration` \> `Options` \>
`Monitoring` page:

  - Enable Perfdata Synchronization (Centcore)
  - Enable Logs Synchronization (Centcore)

For performance issues, these options must be disabled if your monitoring system
is running with Centreon Broker.

##### Resource.cfg and CGI.cfg

The resource and CGI configuration objects are now specific to each monitoring
poller. The values of $USERx$ macros can be different from one poller to
another.

##### Interval length

The `interval_length` is now a global parameter that you have to set in
`Administration` \> `Options` \> `Monitoring`, although it should be left at `60
seconds` in most cases.

#### Centstorage

##### Supported data source types

*Centreon Broker* now supports all of the RRDtool data source types (COUNTER,
GAUGE, DERIVE and ABSOLUTE). This support will not be added to *Centstorage* as
it will soon be replaced by *Centreon Broker*.

See the `Centreon Broker documentation <centreon-broker:graphic_types>` to learn
how you can convert your existing plugins.
