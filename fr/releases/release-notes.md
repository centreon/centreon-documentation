<!--Centreon MAP -->

#### Centreon MAP 20.04.0

Released April, 17 2020.

**New features**

The licensing system has been simplified.

The MAP license resides now on the Centreon **central** server, as any other
commercial extension. No worry, the compatibility with the previous licensing
mecanism (license on the map server) is maintained.

Anyway, if you want to perfectly finish your migration, you may ask the support
team to generate a new Centreon Map license for your Central server and upload :
