## Prerequisites

### Centreon Plugin

Install this plugin on each needed poller:

``` shell
yum install centreon-plugin-Operatingsystems-Windows-Restapi
```

### Nsclient++

This plugin pack requires the use of:

  - the Exchange 2010 plugin provided
    [here](https://forge.centreon.com/projects/centreon-plugins/repository)
  - NSClient++ package provided by Centreon, installed and configured on your
    target server as described on <http://documentation.centreon.com>

You can download it
[here](https://download.centreon.com/?action=product&product=agent-nsclient&version=0.51&secKey=59d646114079212e03ec09454456a938)

Note: Powershell and `Microsoft.Exchange.Management.PowerShell.E2010` snap-in
have to be installed on Exchange Server

Note: If you use the NSClient++ installer provided by Centreon, the plugin is
already included in centreon\_plugins.exe configured in NSClient++

If you have some problems with the centreon\_plugins.exe, you can build it using
[following
procedure](https://documentation.centreon.com/docs/centreon-nsclient/en/latest/windows_agent.html#build-your-own-executable)

Note: You can use options `--remote-host`, `--remote-user` and
`--remote-password` to execute services from another Windows Server (the Windows
still need powershell and the snap-in)

Warning: Set service macro `MAILBOX` with the following syntax:

    DOMAIN\username

Warning: Don't use '\!' character in centreon macro configuration\!\!\!

Warning: Service `Queues` works on exchange server with the good role.
