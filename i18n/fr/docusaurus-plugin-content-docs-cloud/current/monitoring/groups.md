## Description

In Centreon, it is possible to group together one or more objects within different groups:

* Host Groups
* Service Groups
* Contact Groups

Generally speaking, groups are containers in which sets of objects having a common property can be grouped together:

* Same material identity (Dell, HP, IBM, etc., servers), logical identity (network equipment) or geographical identity
  (Europe, Asia, Africa, North America, etc.)
* Belonging to the same application (CMS application, etc.) or to a same sector of activity (Salary management, etc.)
* Etc.

### Service Groups and Host Groups

Host groups and service groups are used to group together objects by logical entities. They are used to:

* Configure ACLs to link a set of resources to a type of profile
* Allow viewing of availability reports per group. Generate a “Paris Agency” availability report for resources.
* Enable viewing the status of a set of objects by selecting in the search filters of a group of objects
* Search several performance graphs quickly by browsing the object tree structure by group and then by resource

Generally speaking, we try to group together hosts by functional level. E.g.: DELL and HP hosts or Linux, Windows,
etc., hosts. 
We also try to group services by application jobs. E.g.: Salary management application, ERP Application, etc.

> For the hosts belonging to a host group, the retention of RRD files can be defined in the host group. This definition
> overrides the global definition. In the event that the same host belongs to several groups each possessing a
> retention definition, the highest value will be selected for the host.

### Contact Groups

Contact Groups are used to notify contacts:

* On definition of a host or of a service
* On definition of an escalation of notifications

In addition, the groups of contacts are also used during the definition of an access group.

Consequently, it is necessary to group together contacts in a logical way. Most of the time, they are grouped together
according to their roles in the information systems. E.g.: DSI, Windows Administrators, Linux Administrators, Person
in charge of the application of Salary Management, etc.
