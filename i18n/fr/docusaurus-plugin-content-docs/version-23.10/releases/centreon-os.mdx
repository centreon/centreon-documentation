<details open>
  <summary>Enhancements</summary>

- Broker management of SQL database connections has been improved.

This secures the utilization of up to 3 connections to the database, improving the performance in updating the real time data.
- The RRD files used to store status history are now rebuilt at the same time as metric files.
- Broker now ignores incorrect filter settings if these prevent some features from functioning.
