## Centreon Collect

### 24.10.0

Release date: `October 30, 2024`

<details open>
  <summary>Enhancements</summary>

**Engine**
- Engine can now handle extra configuration files to complement/overload the centengine.cfg file so that custom configurations remain unchanged when the standard configuration is exported.
- Added a new centengine parameter (`send_recovery_notifications_anyways`) to force sending a recovery notification even when the resource is outside of its notification period. This aims at keeping third-party tools up-to-date at any time when they are fed notifications.
- The whitelist now works with all the commands executed by Engine, including notifications and event handlers.

**Other**

- [Broker]The spdlog logger library has been mutualized for Engine and Broker, as well as the log files. This change will not impact Broker's logs, but Engine will log all its messages (including broker-module's messages) in centengine.log.
- [gRPC API] The GetHost function has been improved to return more information.
- [Packaging] Collect packages are now also available for Debian 12 (bookworm) ARM64 (for pollers on Raspberry Pi).
