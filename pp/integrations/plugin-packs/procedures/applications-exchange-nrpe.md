| X         | NRPEPORT         | Port used to reach the NRPE server (default: '5666')                   |
| X         | NRPETIMEOUT      | Timeout to connect to the NRPE Server (default: '10')                  |

## Important information

* The *Queue* monitoring Service only works on Exchange Server running with the 
hub/transport role. 
* Use this format to define MAILBOX macro at the service level: `DOMAIN\\USER`
* You cannot use the `|` nor `!` character in your Centreon Macro definitions. Prefer using NSClient++ API if you need this.
