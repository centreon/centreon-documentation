## Overview

The Monitoring Connector *Quadstor* works with a NRPE agent to monitor Quadstor virtual 
tape library (VTL). 

## Pack assets

### Monitored objects

* Quadstor VTL:
    * Disks
    * Jobs 
    * Tapes

### Collected metrics

*Coming soon* 

## Prerequisites

### NRPE Server

On RPM-Based distribution, you can use the centreon-nrpe3-daemon package deploying 
a preconfigured version of the NRPE Server. 

Most of the Linux distributions provide a NRPE package you can deploy using the system
package default manager. When using these, it's important to modify following directives
in the config files: 

* `allowed_hosts`

```shell
[...]
# ALLOWED HOST ADDRESSES
# This is an optional comma-delimited list of IP address or hostnames
# that are allowed to talk to the NRPE daemon. Network addresses with a bit mask
# (i.e. 192.168.1.0/24) are also supported. Hostname wildcards are not currently
# supported.
allowed_hosts=X.X.X.X,X.Y.Z.V
[...]
```

* `dont_blame_nrpe`

```shell
[...]
# ALLOWED HOST ADDRESSES
# This is an optional comma-delimited list of IP address or hostnames
# that are allowed to talk to the NRPE daemon. Network addresses with a bit mask
# (i.e. 192.168.1.0/24) are also supported. Hostname wildcards are not currently
# supported.
dont_blame_nrpe=1
[...]
```

**Important note: the `NASTY_METACHARS` parameter should be left as its default value.
Modifying it might open serious security hole and RCE exploitation from an attacker.**
