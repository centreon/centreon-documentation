title: Getting started - Develop your Plugins, ship your Packs!
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

This section aims to give an overview of the centreon-plugins philosophy and how 
you can leverage the centreon-plugins perl framework (or not) and create Packs on top
of it.

The recommended path is the following:

- [Plugins guidelines](../dev-resources/plugins-guidelines.md) - Understand major
concepts and features to know before developing any plugins
- [Plugins quickstart guide](../dev-resources/develop-with-centreon-plugins.md) - Get the 
big picture and understand patterns that will enable you to code with our framework
- [Packs creation](../dev-resources/create-your-own-packs.md) - Understand the JSON structure
of the Packs, and learn how to use them within Centreon
