This section aims to give an overview of the centreon-plugins philosophy and how
you can leverage the centreon-plugins perl framework (or not) and create Packs on top
of it.

The recommended path is the following:

- [Plugins guidelines](../dev-resources/plugins-guidelines.md) - Understand the major
concepts and features you need to know before developing any plugins.
- [Plugins quickstart guide](../dev-resources/develop-with-centreon-plugins.md) - Get the
big picture and understand patterns that will enable you to code with our framework.

Need some help? Unanswered questions? Smoggy concepts? Just reach out to us on [Slack](https://centreon.slack.com) or on our community platform
[The Watch](https://thewatch.centreon.com). Feel free to submit an idea if you would like to see a specific topic covered within this section.
