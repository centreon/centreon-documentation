## How do I know the version of my poller?

To know the version of your poller, go to **Configuration > Pollers > Pollers**. The version of Engine for your poller is displayed in the **Version** column.

## Which version should my poller have?

* Your poller should be in the latest available version: currently, 24.10.x.
* Version 24.04 is compatible with Centreon Cloud, but it is recommended to [upgrade](../installation/poller-update-upgrade.md) it to 24.10.x.
* All older versions are no longer supported and should be [upgraded](../installation/poller-update-upgrade.md).
