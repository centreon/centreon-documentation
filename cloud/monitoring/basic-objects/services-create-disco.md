title: Creating services automatically
---

Services can be created automatically in several ways:

- When you [create a host manually](hosts) using a [Plugin Pack](../pluginpacks), and select **Create Services linked to the Template too**, the services for the host will be created automatically.

- Using the [services discovery feature](../discovery/services-discovery) to detect services and create them automatically in Centreon. Autodiscovery is done using [Plugin Packs](../pluginpacks).
