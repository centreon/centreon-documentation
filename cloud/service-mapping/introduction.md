The service mapping capabilities in Centreon rely on the **Centreon Business
Activity Monitoring (BAM)** extension.

**Centreon Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)** helps ITSM and business
operation teams gain a common perspective to align IT with business. Based on
ITIL practices, it measures real-time IT operating vitals from
Centreon-monitored data to show crucial correlations to service performance.
Prioritizing and proactively managing IT operations and service delivery for
the required SLA becomes easier. Centreon BAM contributes to showing that IT counts for
business operations.

**Centreon BAM** uses an advanced Business Activities (BA) calculation engine
based on Key Performance Indicators.

The graphical representation of the data appears in real time on a console that
is dedicated to monitoring IT activities.

This documentation is intended to assist you in rolling out business activities and
making the best use of the real-time and reporting data in **Centreon BAM**.

Definitions:

  - **BA**: Business Activity
  - **BV**: Business View: the displayed business activity
  - **KPI**: Key Performance Indicator: the weighted indicator considered in the
    BA calculation.
