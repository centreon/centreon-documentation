Media are images used by the Centreon web interface. These images are used to
represent the monitored resource in a more intuitive way, propose backgrounds
for cartography modules, etc.

> You must be logged into Centreon with an administrator or editor profile.

## Adding images

This procedure explains how to add images manually.

To add an image in Centreon, go to **Administration > Parameters > Images** and
click **Add**.

The **Images** page is displayed.

- The **Existing or new directory** field can be used to add a new folder in the
image folder or to choose an existing folder into which the image can be
copied.
- The **Image or archive** field can be used to select the image or the set of
images contained in an archive that will be imported.
- The **Comments** field can be used to describe the image.
