## About users and organizations

### User accounts information

User accounts are managed in the [Centreon CIAM](../ciam/ciam.md) (Customer Identity and Access Management) module: the Centreonâ€™s access management tool. Your administrator needs to create an organization so that all team members can work on the same Centreon platform. According to your needs, you may have one or several organizations.

### How to create an organization for your trial platform?

There are two steps to setting up your Centreon Cloud trial platform for an organization:

- Your administrator should get your platform ready, following the procedure explained in this [article](article the watch). Your organization will then be created.

- Once the platform is ready, the administrator invites other users from your organization to the platform, through Centreon CIAM. Each user has an account on Centreon CIAM, through which they can access your organization's trial platform.

> Once the platform is set up, you can test Centreon Cloud trial for 14 days, and monitor up to 100 hosts.
