* **Home** shows [custom views](create-custom-view).
  Your workspace may be blank for now. Once you configure customizable widgets, you will see data and charts according
  to your customization.
* **Monitoring** provides a combined view of the statuses of all monitored items in real and delayed time using logs and
  performance graphics.
* **Reporting** provides an intuitive view (using diagrams) of the evolution of monitoring over a given time period.
* **Configuration** allows you to configure all monitored items and the monitoring infrastructure.
* **Administration** lets you access your user account.

## Top banner

### Pollers section

The left part of the top banner shows the health of your platform in real time:

* whether all pollers are running or not: the icon becomes red when a poller has not sent data to the central server for at least 15 minutes
* whether checks are running late or not. If the icon is orange or red, this may mean that your pollers are monitoring too many resources.

Click the **pollers** icon to expand the menu. On the menu, click **Configure pollers** to access page **Configuration > Pollers > Pollers**.

### Hosts and services section (top counters)

To the right of the top banner, statistics show the number of resources that are being monitored, with a specific status:

* For hosts: number of hosts with a **Down**, **Unreachable** and **Up** status.
* For services: number of services with a **Critical**, **Warning**, **Unknown** and **OK** status.

These numbers include unconfirmed (SOFT) alerts, but do not include resources that are acknowledged or in downtime. Pending resources are shown by a blue dot on the **hosts** or **services** icons.

Click on a circle representing a status:

* Page **Monitoring > Resources status** opens.
* The page is filtered according to the type of resource and the corresponding status.

Click the **hosts** or **services** icon to expand the menu and display the details of the hosts and services.

## Change the user interface language

On the banner, click on the profile icon, then click on **Edit profile**:
