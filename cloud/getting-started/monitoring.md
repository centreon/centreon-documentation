title: How do I monitor a resource?
---

To monitor a resource in Centreon Cloud:

1. Create the resource.
2. Link the resource to the poller you want it to be monitored by.
3. Link the resource to the correct template provided by a [Plugin Pack](../monitoring/pluginpacks).
4. [Export the configuration](../monitoring/monitoring-servers/deploying-a-configuration.md). The resource appears in the **Monitoring > Resources status** page, where you can track any changes in status.

Here are a few tutorials to help you getting started with your monitoring:
