## Definition and architecture

- Read the definition of a poller [here](../resources/glossary.md#poller).

- Go to [**Architecture of Centreon Cloud**](./architecture.md) to understand how the poller works in the Centreon Cloud infrastructure. 

## Installation

1. Before you install a poller, you need to make sure the [requirements](../installation/prerequisites.md) are met.

2. Then you can follow the [installation](../installation/deploy-poller.md) procedure.

Once the poller is installed, we recommend [securing](../installation/poller-secure.md) it and making sure they remain [updated](../installation/poller-update-upgrade.md). If you have more than one poller, we also recommend having your pollers [monitor each other](../installation/poller-monitor.md) rather than having them monitor themselves.

## Troubleshooting

We have a section dedicated to [troubleshooting pollers](../installation/poller-troubleshoot.md) to help you out, many users also help each other on our community platform [The Watch](https://thewatch.centreon.com/).
