title: Architecture of Centreon Cloud
---

Your Centreon platform consists of a central server provided by Centreon, and by pollers that you install in your infrastructure.

* **Central server**:
  * The central server is provided to you by Centreon, ready to use.
  * The central server does not monitor resources in your infrastructure (the pollers do).
  * The central server has a [user interface](interface.md), in which you can see resources monitored by all pollers.
  * You can reach the user interface from anywhere with a web browser at `<organization>.<region>.centreon.cloud`.
  * The central server is hosted in the cloud.
  * Centreon installs and upgrades central servers.

* **One or more pollers**:
  * Pollers monitor resources in your infrastructure. They should be in the same network as the resources they will monitor.
  * Pollers do not have a user interface (you see the pollers' activity on the central server's interface).
  * Pollers are part of your infrastructure, which means better security, latency and bandwidth.
  * You [install your pollers](../installation/deploy-poller.md) using a simple script.
  * A VPN connects your pollers with the central server.
