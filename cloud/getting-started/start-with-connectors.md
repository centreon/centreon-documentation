## Definition

Monitoring Connectors are the easiest way to monitor resources. They provide ready-to-use monitoring templates (i.e., a "pack"), and a plugin to execute checks. Read [more about Monitoring Connectors here](../monitoring/pluginpacks.md).

## Procedure

Install the Monitoring Connectors you need on each poller that will monitor resources using it.

1. To access the Monitoring Connectors catalog, go to **Configuration > Monitoring Connector Manager**.
2. To install a pack, click the **+** button in the corresponding tile.

Follow this video tutorial to see how to search, install, update and remove Monitoring Connectors.
