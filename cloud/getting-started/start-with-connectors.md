title: Getting started with Monitoring Connectors

## Definition

Monitoring Connectors are the easiest way to monitor resources. They provide ready-to-use monitoring templates (i.e., a "pack"), and a plugin to execute checks. Read [more about Monitoring Connectors here](../monitoring/pluginpacks.md).

## Procedure

Install the Monitoring Connectors you need on each poller that will monitor resources using it.

1. To access the Monitoring Connectors catalog, go to **Configuration > Monitoring Connector Manager**.
2. To install a pack, hover over the icon with the mouse and click the **+** button.

## Troubleshooting

In case of a problem, a troubleshooting section is available in the [Monitoring Connectors section](/pp/integrations/plugin-packs/getting-started/how-to-guides/troubleshooting-plugins/). Also, feel free to ask any questions you may have on our community platform [The Watch](https://thewatch.centreon.com/).
