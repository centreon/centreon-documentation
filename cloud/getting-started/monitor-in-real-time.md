title: Monitoring resources in real time
---

Once you have set up your first host, go to **Monitoring > Resources Status** to follow the status of its resources in real time.

## Video tutorials

On the **Resources Status** page you can perform the following actions:

* [Acknowledge an event](../alerts-notifications/acknowledge.md), to notify your team that you have taken the problem into account.
* [Plan a downtime](../alerts-notifications/downtimes.md) on resources that you know will be offline at a certain time, to avoid receiving unnecessary alerts.
* [Perform a check on a resource](../alerts-notifications/resources-status.md#refresh-a-status) so as to refresh its status quickly.
