## Adding downtime

### Principle

Downtime is a period during which the notifications to a
resource are disabled. Downtimes are used during a programmed
maintenance operation. They save us from receiving false positive alerts.

> It is important to select all the resources necessary to prevent
> false positives and false negatives. In addition, the time spent in
> this state is taken into account during the generation of the
> availability data.

There are two types of downtime:

-   **Fixed** downtime: starts and stops at the planned time.
-   **Flexible** downtime: starts during the planned time window
    as soon as an incident is detected and finishes when the planned time in
    seconds expires.

### Practice

There are several ways to define downtime:

-   From the **Resources Status** page
-   From the detail sheets of a host or of the service
-   From the real-time monitoring interface
-   From the **Downtime** menu

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="Resources Status page" label="Resources Status page">

1. Go to **Monitoring > Resources Status**.
2. Use one of the following methods:
    - Select the object(s) that you want to define downtime on, and then click the **Set Downtime** button above the list of resources.
    - Hover over the resource you want to define downtime on, and then click the **Set Downtime** icon that appears on the left.

    The following window appears:

    -   The **From** and **To** fields define the beginning and
    end date of the downtime period. Downtime cannot start or end after December 31, 2099, 11:59 pm.

    -   If the **Fixed** box is checked, the downtime period is fixed. Otherwise, it
    is flexible.

    -   If the downtime period is flexible, the **Duration** field defines the
    length of the downtime.

    -   The **Comments** field can be used to indicate why downtime is
    defined.

<TabItem value="Detailed sheet of an object" label="Detailed sheet of an object">

1.  Access the detail page of an object
2.  In the category: **Commands**, click **Schedule downtime for this
    host/service**

    The following window appears:

    is flexible
-   If the downtime period is flexible, the **Duration** field defines the

    defined.

## Recurrent downtimes

### Principle

Downtime is a period during which the notifications to a
host or a service are disabled. Downtime periods are convenient during
maintenance operations on a host or a service: they allow us to avoid
receiving false positives.

Recurrent downtime periods are downtime periods that recur
repetitively.

Example: A backup of the virtual machines is performed every day from
8 PM to midnight. This type of backup has a tendency to saturate the
CPU use of all the virtual machines. It is necessary to program
recurrent downtime periods on the services concerned to avoid receiving
notifications from 8 PM to midnight.

### Practice

There are two types of downtime:

-   The **fixed** downtime period: This means that the downtime period
    takes place during exactly the time period defined.
-   The **flexible** downtime period: This means that if, during the time
    period defined, the service or the host returns a Not-OK status, the
    downtime period lasts a certain number of seconds (to be defined in
    the form) from the moment when the host or the status returns a
    Not-OK status.

To add a recurrent downtime period, go into the
**Monitoring > Downtimes > Recurrent Downtimes** menu and click
**Add**.

#### Configuration of Downtime periods

-   The **Name** and **Description** fields are used to give a name and
    describe the recurrent downtime period.
-   The **Enable** field is used to enable or disable the downtime
    period.
-   The **Periods** field is used to define one or more periods of
    recurrent downtime periods. To add a period, click the symbol
    ![image](../assets/common/navigate_plus.png).

It is possible to choose three types of period:

-   Weekly: to choose the days of the week
-   Monthly: to choose the days of the month
-   Specific date: to choose specific dates

-   The **Days** field defines the day(s) concerned.
-   The **Time period** field contains the time period concerned
    (expressed in HH:MM - HH:MM).
-   The **Downtime type** field defines the type of downtime period
    desired.

> It is possible to combine several types of period within the same
> downtime.

#### Relations

-   The **Linked with Hosts** list can be used to choose the host(s)
    concerned by the recurrent downtime period.
-   If **Linked with Host Groups** is chosen with the list linked with
    the host group, all the hosts belonging to this group are concerned
    by the recurrent downtime period.
-   The **Linked with Services** list can be used to choose the
    service(s) concerned by the recurrent downtime period.
-   If a service group is chosen with the list **Linked with Service
    Groups**, all the services belonging to this group are concerned by
    the recurrent downtime period.
