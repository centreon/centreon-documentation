title: Introduction to Centreon MAP
---

Centreon MAP is a solution fully available in the Centreon web interface while offering you the best possible experience in creating, visualizing and sharing graphical representations of your monitored infrastructure.

## Overview

Create, customize, and visualize your maps within a single web interface.

You need first to create your logical views using the MAP editor:

Then you can visualize your map directly in the view mode:

Your maps can be displayed in two ways in the interface:
- In the **Monitoring > Map** page, in view mode.
- In the **Home > Custom Views** page, using a dedicated MAP [widget](../alerts-notifications/custom-views.md).
