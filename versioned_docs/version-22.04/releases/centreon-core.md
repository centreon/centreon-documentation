> Since the rewrite of the OpenID Connect authentication, it is necessary to reconfigure the redirect URL to Centreon in
> the identity provider.

For example replace:
```shell
{protocol}://{server}:{port}/centreon/index.php
```

By:
```shell
{protocol}://{server}:{port}/centreon/authentication/providers/configurations/openid
```

> Moreover, for Web SSO authentication, you need also to change Apache configuration.

For example replace:
```shell
{protocol}://{server}:{port}/centreon/index.php
```

By:
```shell
{protocol}://{server}:{port}/centreon/websso
```

#### New feature

- [Widget] A new widget is now available to display listings from **ntopng** and provide quick access to detail pages in the **ntopng** WUI

## Centreon Collect

### 22.04.0

#### Centreon Engine

##### Enhancements

- New logger, more readable, more configurable. The former logger is still available for the moment.
- Flapping was not detected for volatile services until now. This is a new behavior that can be disabled. Following [a suggestion on TheWatch](https://thewatch.centreon.com/data-collection-6/volatile-and-flapping-212).
- Flapping used to be detected on SOFT states for hosts and on HARD states for services. This seemed illogical so it will now be based on SOFT states for both. Based on [PR #522](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-engine/pull/522).
- Set default values in anticipation of removing the following parameters:
  - `translate_passive_host_checks` to `1`
  - `passive_host_checks_are_soft` to `1`
  - `max_check_result_reaper_time` to `30`
- New configuration files:
  - `tags.cfg` for host groups, host categories, service groups and service categories.
  - `severities.cfg` for host and service severities

#### Centreon Broker

##### Enhancements

- A new output type has been created, `unified_sql`, to replace both `sql` and `storage` in one unique output.
- New BBDO protocol version: 3.0.0. Some broker events are now sent using Protobuf arrays. This has benefits such as smaller bandwidth consumption and smaller database updates. The broker event types that have been converted are: host, host status, service, service status and RRD rebuild messages. The protocol version (`bbdo_version`) must be identical in all parts of the broker configuration.
- Broker feeds new tables for real time monitoring information.
- A lot of new runtime statistics are available with the gRPC API.

##### Breaking changes

As stated above, all broker instances (central, RRD, modules) must use the same BBDO protocol version to be able to communicate. This means that pollers using 21.10 or older releases won't be able to send data to a 22.04 central server using BBDO 3.0.0. Please read carefully our upgrade procedure.

## Centreon Gorgone

### 22.04.0

#### Enhancements

- Added ability to set cipher and key rotation time for encrypted communication
- Added new httpsserverng module
- Added the possibility for the poller to communicate using the socket web client instead of using the ZMQ protocol
- Extended configuration to add multiple directories at the same time
