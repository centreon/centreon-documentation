## To use Centreon [IT-100](IT100) or to test the solution

- Use a [ready-to-use virtual machine](../installation/installation-of-a-central-server/using-virtual-machines).

## To install Centreon in production

- Use the [Centreon ISO](../installation/installation-of-a-central-server/using-centreon-iso): if you want to
  install both the OS (CentOS 7) and Centreon.
- Use [RPM packages](../installation/installation-of-a-central-server/using-packages): if you already have the
  OS and you only want to install Centreon. Centreon supports the following operating systems: CentOS 7, RedHat/OracleLinux 7 or 8.
