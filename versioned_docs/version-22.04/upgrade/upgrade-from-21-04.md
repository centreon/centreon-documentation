title: Upgrade from Centreon 21.04
---
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';


This chapter describes how to upgrade your Centreon platform from version 21.04
to version 22.04.

> When you upgrade your central server, make sure you also upgrade all your remote servers and your pollers. All servers in your architecture must have the same version of Centreon. In addition, all servers must use the same [version of the BBDO protocol](../developer/developer-broker-bbdo.md#switching-versions-of-bbdo).

> If you want to migrate your Centreon server to Oracle Linux / RHEL 8
> you need to follow the [migration procedure](../migrate/migrate-from-el-to-el.md)

## Prerequisites

### Perform a backup

Be sure that you have fully backed up your environment for the following
servers:

- Central server
- Database server

### Update the RPM signing key

> For security reasons, the keys used to sign Centreon RPMs are rotated regularly. The last change occurred on October 14, 2021. When upgrading from an older version, you need to go through the [key rotation procedure](../security/key-rotation.md#existing-installation), to remove the old key and install the new one.

## Upgrade the Centreon Central server

### Update the Centreon repository

Run the following commands:

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8" label="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8">

```shell
dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
dnf config-manager --add-repo https://packages.centreon.com/rpm-standard/22.04/el8/centreon-22.04.repo
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CentOS 7" label="CentOS 7">

```shell
yum install -y yum-utils
yum-config-manager --add-repo https://packages.centreon.com/rpm-standard/22.04/el7/centreon-22.04.repo
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> If you have an offline license, install the corresponding repository for the plugin packs.
> If you are using a Business edition, install the correct Business repository too.
> You can find the repositories on the [support portal](https://support.centreon.com/hc/en-us/categories/10341239833105-Repositories).

### Install the MariaDB repository

```shell
cd /tmp
curl -JO https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup
bash ./mariadb_repo_setup
sed -ri 's/1[0-1]\.[0-9]+/10.5/' /etc/yum.repos.d/mariadb.repo

rm -f ./mariadb_repo_setup
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Upgrade PHP

Centreon 22.04 uses PHP in version 8.0.

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="RHEL 8" label="RHEL 8">

First, you need to install the **remi** repository:
```shell
dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
dnf install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
dnf install -y https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
```

Then, you need to change the PHP stream from version 7.3 to 8.0 by executing the following commands and answering **y**
to confirm:
```shell
dnf module reset php
dnf module install php:remi-8.0
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Oracle Linux 8" label="Oracle Linux 8">

First, you need to install the **remi** repository:
```shell
dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
dnf install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
dnf install -y https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm
```

```
Then, you need to enable the php 8.0 repository
```shell
yum-config-manager --enable remi-php80
```

### Upgrade the Centreon solution

> Make sure all users are logged out from the Centreon web interface
> before starting the upgrade procedure.

If you have installed Business extensions, update the Business repository to version 22.04.
Visit the [support portal](https://support.centreon.com/hc/en-us/categories/10341239833105-Repositories) to get its address.

Stop the Centreon Broker process:
```shell
systemctl stop cbd
```

Delete existing retention files:
```shell
rm /var/lib/centreon-broker/* -f
```

Clean yum cache:

```shell
yum clean all --enablerepo=*
```

Then upgrade all the components with the following command:

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8" label="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8">

```shell
yum update centreon\* php-pecl-gnupg
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CentOS 7" label="CentOS 7">

```shell
yum update centreon\* php-pecl-gnupg
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Accept new GPG keys from the repositories as needed.

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8" label="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8">

Execute the following commands:
```shell
systemctl enable php-fpm
systemctl restart php-fpm
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CentOS 7" label="CentOS 7">

The PHP timezone should be set. Run the command:
```shell
echo "date.timezone = Europe/Paris" >> /etc/php.d/50-centreon.ini
```

> Replace **Europe/Paris** by your time zone. You can find the list of
> supported time zones [here](http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php).

Execute the following commands:
```shell
systemctl stop rh-php73-php-fpm
systemctl disable rh-php73-php-fpm
systemctl enable php-fpm
systemctl start php-fpm
```

Or, if you have PHP 7.4:
```shell
systemctl stop rh-php74-php-fpm
systemctl disable rh-php74-php-fpm
systemctl enable php-fpm
systemctl start php-fpm
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Update your customized Apache configuration

This section only applies if you customized your Apache configuration.

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="RHEL / Oracle Linux 8" label="RHEL / Oracle Linux 8">

When upgrading your platform, the Apache configuration file is not upgraded automatically: the new configuration file brought by the rpm does not replace the old file. You must copy the changes manually to your customized configuration file.

Run a diff between the old and the new Apache configuration files:

```shell
diff -u /etc/httpd/conf.d/10-centreon.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/10-centreon.conf.rpmnew
```

* **10-centreon.conf** (post upgrade): this file contains the custom configuration. It does not contain anthing new brought by the upgrade.
* **10-centreon.conf.rpmnew** (post upgrade): this file is provided by the rpm; it does not contain any custom configuration.

For each difference between the files, assess whether you should copy it from **10-centreon.conf.rpmnew** to **10-centreon.conf**.

In particular, make sure your customized Apache configuration contains the following directive (with **authentication**).

```
<LocationMatch ^\${base_uri}/?(authentication|api/(latest|beta|v[0-9]+|v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+))/.*$>
    ProxyPassMatch "fcgi://127.0.0.1:9042${install_dir}/api/index.php/$1"
</LocationMatch>
```

Check that Apache is configured properly by running the following command:

```shell
apachectl configtest
```

The expected result is the following:

```shell
Syntax OK
```

Restart the Apache and PHP processes to take in account the new configuration:

```shell
systemctl restart php-fpm httpd
```

Then check its status:

```shell
systemctl status httpd
```

If everything is ok, you should have:

```shell

### Finalizing the upgrade

Before starting the web upgrade process, reload the Apache server with the
following command:

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8" label="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8">

```shell
systemctl reload php-fpm httpd
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CentOS 7" label="CentOS 7">

```shell
systemctl reload php-fpm httpd24-httpd
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then log on to the Centreon web interface to continue the upgrade process:

![image](../assets/upgrade/web_update_5.png)

If the Centreon BAM module is installed, refer to the
[upgrade procedure](../service-mapping/upgrade.md).

### Post-upgrade actions

1. Upgrade extensions. From **Administration > Extensions > Manager**, upgrade all extensions, starting
with the following:

    - License Manager,
    - Plugin Packs Manager,
    - Auto Discovery.

    Then you can upgrade all other commercial extensions.

2. Set the following rights on Broker and Engine files:

    ```shell
    chown apache:apache /etc/centreon-engine/*
    chown apache:apache /etc/centreon-broker/*
    su - apache -s /bin/bash -c umask
    ```

3. [Deploy the configuration](../monitoring/monitoring-servers/deploying-a-configuration.md).

4. Restart the processes:

    ```shell
    systemctl restart cbd centengine centreontrapd gorgoned
    ```

## Upgrade the Remote Servers

This procedure is the same as for upgrading a Centreon Central server.

> At the end of the update, configuration should be deployed from the Central server.
