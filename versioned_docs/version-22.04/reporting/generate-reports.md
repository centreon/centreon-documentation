## Jobs

A job is an entity that you configure to be able to generate a report and should be configured in terms of:

- A report design to use
- Centreon objects (hosts, services, host groups, service groups, business activities, etc.)
- A specific period (last month, current month, yesterday etc.. )

### Job list

The following menu lists jobs according to their state: running,
scheduled, failed, stopped or finished:
`Reporting > Business Intelligence > Configuration > Jobs`

### Adding / Editing a job

To generate a report, you need to create a job by clicking on "Add" in the job listing page. The job configuration 
is done in two main steps (tabs):

- Select the report design you want to use (see all the designs available [here](../assets/reporting/Centreon-MBI-Sample-Reports.pdf))
- Select the perimeter on which to generate the report 

Two optionals steps (tabs) can be done to :

- Publish the report
- Tune the job  

The following menu is used for adding a new scheduled job:

![image](../assets/reporting/guide/addJob.png)

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="1. Configuration" label="1. Configuration">

A report generation job *must* be linked to a report design ("Report design").

Several report ouput formats are available:

 - Acrobat PDF
 - Microsoft Excel
 - Microsoft Word
 - Microsoft Powerpoint
 - CSV: Only the first BIRT Data Set of the report can be exported in CSV format. Usually, 
 this format requires a specially designed BIRT report.

Reports can be generated in other languages. Currently available
languages are:

 - French
 - US English

The icon on the right of the selection menu allows you to refresh the
list of available report languages in the case you want to add translation by yourself

#### Scheduling

A job can be executed in 3 different ways: immediately, scheduled for later or in a cyclic way.

**Immediate execution** 

The job will start when saving the form.

![image](../assets/reporting/guide/scheduleImmediate.png)

**SCHEDULED > One shot** 

![image](../assets/reporting/guide/scheduleOS.png)

**CYCLIC**

This parameter causes the job to run on a daily, weekly or monthly
basis.

![image](../assets/reporting/guide/scheduleRegular.png)

For cyclic jobs, the period is calculated automatically according to job
frequency:

 - Daily reports cover the previous day.
 - Weekly reports cover the previous week.
 - Monthly reports cover the previous month.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="2. Report parameters" label="2. Report parameters">

The "Report Parameters" menu is used to set the specific parameters for the report design.

![image](../assets/reporting/guide/jobParameter.png)

This part of the menu changes according to the report design selected
under the "Configuration" tab of the scheduled job.

There are three types of fields in this form:

- Text fields
- Radio buttons
- Selection and multi-selection menus for the following resources:

    - Hosts
    - Metrics
    - Host groups
    - Service groups
    - Service categories
    - Time periods
    - Business groups (Centreon BAM module is required)
    - Business activities (Centreon BAM module is required)
    - Images that will be inserted in the reports (logo for example).

**Note**: A value must be specified for each field in this menu except for the multi-selection 
parameter when metrics are excluded.

By defaut, all metrics will be applied.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="3. Report publication (Optional)" label="3. Report publication (Optional)">

 Once a report is generated, it can be automatically published using pre-defined rules. When creating
 a job, you can create several rules under the tab "Publication".

![image](../assets/reporting/guide/jobPublication.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="4. Tunning (Optional)" label="4. Tunning (Optional)">

The "Tuning" menu contains three parameters:

-   **Report color theme:** Color theme management has been implemented,
    allowing you to choose a color palette. Seven default themes are
    available: Maroon, Orange, Blue, Ice, Green, Multicolor-1 and
    Multicolor-2. 

    > Theme color doesn't apply to business activity report

    Available color palettes are:

    ![image](../assets/reporting/guide/theme.png)

    The default color theme can be changed through the Centreon MBI General
    options menu. For more information, see the General options chapter
    [General options](configure.md#general-options)

-   **Multiplier coefficient of the scheduled task**: Each report design
    has a weight. A scheduled task can multiply this weight according to
    the parameters used to run the report design. The sum of the weight
    of the running tasks can not exceed the maximum load the reporting
    engine can handle (defined in General Options).
-   **Administrator e-mail notification**: Enable or disable
    notification when scheduled job is generated.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Accessing generated reports

After a scheduled job is executed, a new report is generated and then
stored on the **Centreon** server. You can then view or download it
using the following menu **Reporting > Monitoring Business Intelligence > Archives**
