Below is a list of know issues and/or bugs you may encounter.
We try to provide workarounds. We apply fixes when
necessary and are forever improving our software in order to solve any
issues for future releases.

## Centreon Web

### You have reached the maximum of id into centreon_storage.index_data

#### Workaround

Play the following query into MariaDB :

In your monitoring database :
```sql
ALTER TABLE index_data MODIFY id bigint unsigned AUTO_INCREMENT;
ALTER TABLE metrics MODIFY index_id bigint unsigned;
```

In your configuration database :
```sql
ALTER TABLE ods_view_details MODIFY index_id bigint unsigned;
ALTER TABLE virtual_metrics MODIFY index_id bigint unsigned;
```

> Depending on your metrics volumes, this operation could be more or less long.

#### Description

If you have a very large infrastructure, it is possible that the `servicemetric_id` column size has been reached.

#### Workaround

> Depending on your data volume, this operation could be more or less long.

* Connect in the reporting server
* Disable cron job in `/etc/cron.d/centreon-bi-engine`:

    ```shell
    #30 4 * * * root /usr/share/centreon-bi//bin/centreonBIETL -d >> /var/log/centreon-bi//centreonBIETL.log 2>&1
    ```

* Execute the following queries in `centreon_storage` database:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE mod_bi_metricdailyvalue MODIFY servicemetric_id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL;
    ALTER TABLE mod_bi_metrichourlyvalue MODIFY servicemetric_id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL;
    ALTER TABLE mod_bi_metricmonthcapacity MODIFY servicemetric_id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL;
    ALTER TABLE mod_bi_metriccentiledailyvalue MODIFY servicemetric_id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL;
    ALTER TABLE mod_bi_metriccentilemonthlyvalue MODIFY servicemetric_id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL;
    ALTER TABLE mod_bi_metriccentileweeklyvalue MODIFY servicemetric_id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL;
    ALTER TABLE mod_bi_servicemetrics MODIFY id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;
    ```

* Enable cron job in `/etc/cron.d/centreon-bi-engine` :

    ```shell
    30 4 * * * root /usr/share/centreon-bi//bin/centreonBIETL -d >> /var/log/centreon-bi//centreonBIETL.log 2>&1
    ```

* If the operation occured during the usual launch of the scheduled task, run the following command indicating the correct start and end dates:

    ```shell
    /usr/share/centreon-bi/bin/centreonBIETL -rIEDP -s YYYY-MM-DD -e YYYY-MM-DD
    ```
