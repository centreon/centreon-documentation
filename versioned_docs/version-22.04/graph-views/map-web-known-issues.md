This topic lists known issues the MAP team is currently working on:

- Status box works well except for Hostgroups and Servicegroups where the display is not correct.
- Redirection to the Monitoring menu is not working when clicking from a resource in the view mode.
- Accessing MAP in HTTPS is not working.
- In the MAP editor, you are not able to set properties on graphs.
- When migrating Geo Maps (standard maps with a geographical background using a tiles provider such as MapBox for example), these maps objects will be migrated, but tiles will not appear in the background.
- The ability to change language is not yet implemented in the interface.
- Curve colors for line charts are constantly changing.
