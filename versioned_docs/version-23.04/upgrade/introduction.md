title: Introduction to upgrade
---

This chapter describes how to upgrade your Centreon monitoring platform, i.e. switching between major versions (for instance, from 21.10 to 23.04).

This procedure is linked to your initial version of Centreon. You will have to
**use packages** if you already installed using Centreon ISO or an RPM, and
source files if you installed from sources. Before upgrading Centreon, remember
to make a backup your system.

> If you are using at least one of the BAM, MAP or MBI modules, you have to install
> their new repository to avoid dependency problems.
> Refer to [this page](../reporting/upgrade.md#update-the-repository).

> If you want to change the OS of the host server, follow the [migration procedure](../migrate/introduction.md). (If you want to migrate a platform that uses **Centreon Poller Display 1.6.x**, refer
> to the corresponding [migration procedure](../migrate/poller-display-to-remote-server.md).)

> The upgrade process can start only from versions **2.8.0** and later. If you
> have an earlier version, please update to the latest *2.8.x* version first.
