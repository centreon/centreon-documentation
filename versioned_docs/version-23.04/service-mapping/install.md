> Centreon BAM is a Centreon **extension** that requires a valid license key. To
> purchase one, contact

## Prerequisites

See the [software requirements](../installation/prerequisites.md#software).

Install BAM on the central server.
The central server and Centreon BAM must be installed in the same major versions (i.e. both in 23.04.x).
If you want to be able to view the Business activities monitored by a remote server, install BAM on the remote server too. When BAM is installed on a remote server, the Business activities will only include the resources monitored by the remote server.

## Installation

### Install the package

Add the Centreon Business repository, you can find it on the
[support portal](https://support.centreon.com/hc/en-us/categories/10341239833105-Repositories).

And install the package using the following command:

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8" label="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8">

``` shell
dnf install centreon-bam-server
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 9" label="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 9">
