Open Source software supplied by Centreon is generally available in [3 formats](../installation/compatibility.md#operating-systems):

* [RPM and DEB packages](https://download.centreon.com) (recommended),
* [Virtual machine](https://download.centreon.com) in OVA and OVF formats,
* [Archives containing the sources](https://download.centreon.com).

> Virtual machines are only suitable to use Centreon IT-100 or to test the solution.

RPM packages are the best format to obtain our software. They are packaged by Centreon experts and relieve
you of any concern over the installation process.

> Centreon recommends using the [Centreon RPM packages](installation-of-a-central-server/using-packages.md) version.

If your platform does not support RPM packages, you should use archives containing the sources of stable versions of
our software and install them manually. Manual compilation of some packages can be complex.
