The **Centreon Open Tickets** is a community module developed to create
tickets to an ITSM platform using API.

Once done provider configuration, the module allows for an operator to
create tickets for hosts and services in a non-ok state using a
dedicated widget. Indeed, a button associated with each host or service
allows you to connect to the API and create the ticket while offering
the possibility to acknowledge in same time the object.

Regarding the widget configuration, it is possible to see the created
tickets by presenting tickets ID and date of creation of these.

section](../integrations/itsm/itsm-overview.md).

A new form appear. Configure the provider regarding his own configuraition.

### Hosts & services

In order for resources (hosts and services) to receive a ticket number,
it is necessary to add a personalized macro to them.

The best way is to create these macros in a host template and a service
template inherited by all objects using models from which all resources
will inherit.

Go to the `Configuration > Hosts > Templates` menu and look for the
**generic-active-host-custom** template and edit this one. Add the macro
**TICKET\_ID** and click on **Save**:

Go to the `Configuration > Services > Templates` menu and look for the
**generic-active-service-custom** template and edit this one. Add the
macro **TICKET\_ID** and click on **Save**:

## Advanced configuration

This module offers ready-to-use providers. However, depending on the
configuration of your ITSM, it may be necessary to modify these to adapt
them to your environment.

### List definition

Before opening a ticket, an user can choose some options in a popup. An
option can be a select list. In the configuration provider, you can
configure it in `Lists` and `Custom list definition`. For each entry in
`Lists`, you can define:

-   **Id** : alphanumeric value (must be unique)
-   **Label** : displayed in the popup
-   **Type** : which kind of list. There is 3 kinds of lists
    -   Provider lists (data from the ticketing software directly)
    -   Centreon lists (like `Host group`)
    -   Custom lists (data from `Custom list definition` configuration.
        **Id** fields must be identical)
-   **Mandatory** : checked it if the user needs to set the option

The module stores the user list selection in an array (can be used in
smarty section like `body` or `mapping ticket arguments`). There are 3
fields (**LIST\_ID** must be replaced):

-   {$select.LIST\_ID.id}
-   {$select.LIST\_ID.value}
-   {$select.LIST\_ID.label}

### Chaining rules

After opening a ticket, you may need to send an email. The chaining
rules system is designed to do it:

-   Create a new rule with the name `emailme` and the provider `Mail`
-   Configure the `emailme` in the rule of your opening system
