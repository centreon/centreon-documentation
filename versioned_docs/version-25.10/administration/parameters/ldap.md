title: Connecting Centreon to an LDAP directory
---
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';


When you connect Centreon to an LDAP directory, users in this directory can log in to Centreon using their LDAP credentials.

Connecting Centreon to an LDAP directory does not create [users](../../monitoring/basic-objects/contacts.md) automatically in Centreon. According to your configuration, users from the LDAP directory can be created automatically when they log in to Centreon, or you can import them manually.

You can [grant rights to these users](../access-control-lists.md) indirectly by adding them to a contact group (which in turn can be included in an [access group](../access-control-lists.md#creating-an-access-group)).

> If you want to use SSO for authentication, please read
> [this procedure](../../connect/sso.md).

## Configuration

Go to **Administration > Parameters > LDAP** and click **Add**.

![image](../../assets/administration/parameters-ldap-add.png)

- **Configuration name** and **Description**: define the name and the
description of the LDAP server
- **Enable LDAP authentication**: enable authentication via the
LDAP server
- **Store LDAP password**: can be used to store user passwords in the
database, which is useful to authenticate users in the event of loss of connection
with the LDAP server
- **Auto import users**:
    - **Yes**: All users in the directory will be able to log in to Centreon. The first time they log in, they will be created in Centreon, on the **Configuration > Contacts > Contacts/Users** page, with their LDAP parameters (last name, first name, email address, etc.).
    - **No**: Users will only be able to log in to Centreon if their account has been imported manually into Centreon.
    - **Import users manually**: Whether or not auto import is enabled, you can use this button to import some users to the list of contacts.

- **LDAP search size limit**: can be used to limit the number of users to search for (1000 users maximum).
- **LDAP search timeout**: can be used define the maximum time for the
LDAP search.
- **Contact template**: defines the [contact template](../../monitoring/basic-objects/contacts-templates.md) that will be linked
to all users imported from this LDAP directory.
- **Default contactgroup**: is used to add a new user to
a default contactgroup. This allows you to [grant rights](../access-control-lists.md) indirectly to the LDAP users.
- **Use service DNS**: indicates if it is necessary to use the DNS server
to solve the IP address of the LDAP directory.
- **Enable LDAP synchronization on login**: If enabled, a user LDAP
synchronization will be performed on login to update the contact data and
calculate new Centreon ACLs.
- **LDAP synchronization interval (in hours)**: Displayed only if the previous
option is enabled. This field is used to specify the time between two LDAP
synchronizations.

> The contact's LDAP data won't be updated in Centreon until the next
> synchronization is expected.
>
> If needed, "on-demand" synchronization is
> available from the **Administration > Session** page and from the
> **Configuration > Users > Contact / Users** list.
>
> The interval is expressed in hours. By default, this field is set to the lower
> value: 1 hour.

> We save a timestamp as reference date in the DB and use the CentAcl CRON to
> update it.
>
> The reference date is used to calculate the next expected LDAP synchronization.
>
> If you modify one of these two fields, the reference timestamp will be reset to
> your current time.
>
> The reference date will not be updated, whether or not you make changes; only the other fields
> / options are updated.

- **LDAP servers**: can be used to add one or more LDAP directories to
which Centreon will connect.

The table below summarizes the settings to add an LDAP server:

| Column       | Description                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Host address | Contains the IP address or DNS name of the LDAP server                 |
| Port         | Indicates the connection port to access the LDAP                       |
| SSL          | Indicates if the SSL protocol is used for the connection to the server |
| TLS          | Indicates if the TLS protocol is used for the connection to the server |

- **Bind user** and **Bind password**: define the user name and the
password for logging on to the LDAP server
- **Protocol version**: indicates the version of the protocol used to
log in
- **Template**: can be used to pre-configure the search filters for users
on the LDAP directory. These filters are used to propose, by default, a search
on the MS Active Directory, Okta, or Posix-type directories.

> Before any import, check the default settings proposed. If you have not selected
> a Model, you will need to define the search filters manually by filling in the
> fields.

> You can use **Okta** as LDAP server with [SWA
> plugin](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_Configure_Template_App.htm).
> Please define:
>
> - **uid=\<USER\>,dc=\<ORGANIZATION\>,dc=okta,dc=com** for the **Bind DN** field
> - **ou=\<OU\>,dc=\<ORGANIZATION\>,dc=okta,dc=com** \*\* for the **Search group
> base DN** field.
