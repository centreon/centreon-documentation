title: Introduction to the migration process
---

Migration procedures apply when you wish to install your Centreon on a different server (typically, to change from an unsupported OS to a [supported OS](../installation/compatibility.md#operating-systems)). You need to install a new OS and a new Centreon platform, then migrate your old data to the new platform. You may need to upgrade your version of Centreon at the same time, if yours is no longer supported.

If you just want to switch to a newer version of Centreon and your current platform is already installed on a supported OS, use the [upgrade procedures](../upgrade/introduction.md) instead.
