title: What actions can you take?
---

Once you have [set up your monitoring](first-supervision.md) and resources are being successfully monitored, go to **Monitoring > Resources Status** to track the status of resources in real time.

On this page you can perform the following actions (hover over the resource's status and click the corresponding button):

- **Acknowledge a resource**: When an event occurs on a resource, you can mark the resource as acknowledged to notify your team that you are aware of the incident and that you will take action to resolve it.

   When a resource is acknowledged, notifications are stopped and the resource is highlighted yellow in monitoring screens.

   Acknowledging a resource does not mean that the incident is over. It will be over when the resource is back to its nominal state (OK or UP).

- **Plan downtime**: Downtime is a period during which notifications are disabled for a resource. When you know that a specific resource is going to be down for maintenance, set downtime on it to avoid receiving unnecessary alerts.

- **Perform a check on a resource**: Execute the check command for the resource immediately. Its status will be refreshed shortly.
