## Centreon Collect

### 24.04.3

Release date: `July 17, 2024`

<details>
  <summary>Bug fixes</summary>

- [Broker] Fixed an issue that occurred when inserting too large metrics into the database, which resulted in an error log.
- [Broker] There were two errors concerning the gnutls version check:
1. The gnutls library on Centreon had to be at least the same version as the one used to compile Broker. Now, Broker checks that the version of the gnutls library is at least 3.6.0.
2. The packaging required a very old version of gnutls.
Now, when Broker is installed we check that the version of gnutls is at least 3.6.0. If the version is older, it will be updated.
- [Broker] Added support for the default connection method to MySQL 8.0.35.

</details>

### 24.04.2

Release date: `June 17, 2024`

<details open>
  <summary>Enhancements</summary>

- [Engine] Added a new centengine parameter (`send_recovery_notifications_anyways`) to force sending a recovery notification even when the resource is outside of its notification period. This aims at keeping third-party tools up-to-date at any time when they are fed notifications.
- [Engine] The whitelist works with all the commands executed by Engine.
- [Engine] Engine can now handle extra configuration files to complement/overload the centengine.cfg file. This enhancement allows you to keep a custom configuration unchanged when exporting the configuration.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Bug fixes</summary>

- [Broker] Fixed an issue where incomplete BAM queries resulted in unnecessary error messages.
