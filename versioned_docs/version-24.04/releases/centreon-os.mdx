<details>
  <summary>Bug fixes</summary>

Release date: `July 29, 2024`

<details>
  <summary>Bug fixes</summary>

2. The packaging required a very old version of gnutls.
Now, when Broker is installed we check that the version of gnutls is at least 3.6.0. If the version is older, it will be updated.
- [Broker] Added support for the default connection method to MySQL 8.0.35.

</details>
