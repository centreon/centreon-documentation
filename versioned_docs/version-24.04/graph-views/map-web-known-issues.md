This topic lists known issues the MAP team is currently working on:

- Anomaly detection services are not yet available for you to use in maps.
- You are not able to customize your elements with font properties.
- When migrating Geo Maps (standard maps with a geographical background using a tile provider such as MapBox), these map objects will be migrated, but tiles will not appear in the background.
- Curve colors for line charts are constantly changing.
