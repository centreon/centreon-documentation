> **From Centreon 24.10, MAP Legacy will no longer be available.** If you are still using MAP Legacy, you will need to migrate to MAP. See [MAP Legacy end of life](https://docs.centreon.com/docs/graph-views/map-legacy-eol/).

Centreon MAP is a data-mapping and visualization tool designed for IT
Operations management (ITOM) administrators and developers. It is
capable of displaying efficient graphic insights and mapping correlated
data in customized user-relevant views.

> Centreon MAP is a Centreon extension that requires a valid [license](../administration/licenses.md).
> To purchase one and retrieve the necessary repositories, contact [Centreon](mailto:sales@centreon.com).

## Overview

Here is an overview of MAP (Legacy). You need first to create logical views using the Desktop client:

Then you can visualize them directly in your browser:

You can also use the geographical view to display resources in the way your IT is spread
over a city, country or world:

Both types of view may be displayed in the same Centreon web user interface:

- Either from the Centreon MAP dedicated user interface, which also includes a search facility.
- Or within a Custom View, using the dedicated Centreon MAP widget.
