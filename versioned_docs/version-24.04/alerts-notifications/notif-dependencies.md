## Principle

Dependencies are used to satisfy two main requirements:

-   Reduce alert fatigue
-   Target the alerts

There are two types of object dependency:

-   **Physical** dependencies between objects: a load balancing switch
    is situated upstream of a set of servers and downstream of a router
-   **Logical** dependencies between objects: the access to a website
    with LDAP authentication depends on the status of the LDAP directory
    itself

## Physical dependencies

Physical dependencies consist of taking into account physical links
between devices. This link can only be defined for **Host**.

The configuration of a physical dependency takes place in the
**Relations** tab of a configuration sheet of a host through the
`Configuration > Hosts > Hosts` menu.

It is possible to define two settings:

-   **Parent Hosts**: signifies that the hosts selected are parents of
    this host (situated upstream). If all the parent hosts selected
    become unavailable or impossible to reach, the host itself will be
    considered by the scheduler as impossible to reach.
-   **Child Hosts**: signifies that the host becomes the parent of all
    the child hosts selected.

> It is not possible to have dependencies between hosts from different
> pollers.

> All the parents of a host must be in a Not-OK status for the host
> itself to be considered impossible to reach. If only one access path
> is down (physical dependencies link), the scheduler will continue to
> monitor this host.

## Logical dependencies

Logical dependencies consist of installing logical links between
multiple objects that may or not be of different types. Example: a service
is in charge of monitoring the access to a web page requiring an
authentication based on LDAP. It is logical that if the LDAP server is
down, the access to the web page will be difficult or even impossible.
In this situation, the only notification issued should concern
the LDAP directory, and not the website.

### Hosts

To configure a logical dependency, go into the
`Configuration > Notifications > Dependencies > Hosts` menu and click
**Add**.

![image](../assets/alerts/03hostdependance.png)

In this case, we have two types of host that come into play: one or more
hosts (called master hosts) of which the status controls the execution
and notification of other hosts (called dependent hosts). If you use the
Centreon Broker, it is also possible to control the execution and
notification of services (called dependent services) from master hosts.

-   The **Name** and **Description** fields indicate the name and the
    description of the dependencies
-   The **Parent relationship** field should be ignored if you use the
    Centreon Engine. If it is enabled, and if the dependency links of
    the master host become unavailable, the dependencies in the process
    of creation are not taken into account.
-   The **Execution Failure Criteria** field indicates the statuses of
    the master host(s) preventing the check of the hosts or the
    dependent services
-   The **Notification Failure Criteria** field indicates the statuses
    of the master host(s) preventing the sending of notifications to the
    hosts or the dependent services
-   The **Hostnames** list defines the master host(s)
-   The **Dependent Host Names** list defines the dependent hosts
-   The **Dependent Services** list defines the dependent services
-   The **Comments** field can be used to comment on the dependencies

### Services

To configure a logical dependency, go into the
`Configuration> Notifications > Dependencies > Services` menu and click
**Add**.

![image](../assets/alerts/03servicedependance.png)

In this case, we have two entities that come into play: the (“master”)
services, which control the execution, and the notification of other
(“dependent”) services. If you use Centreon Broker, it is also possible
to control the execution and the notification of other hosts.

-   The **Name** and **Description** fields indicate the name and
    description of the dependencies
-   The **Parent relationship** field should be ignored if you use the
    Centreon Engine. If it is enabled, and if the links of dependencies
    of the master service become unavailable, the dependencies in the
    process of creation are no longer taken into account.
-   The **Execution Failure Criteria** field indicates the statuses of
    the master service(s) preventing the check of the hosts or the
    dependent services
-   The **Notification Failure Criteria** field indicates the statuses
    of the master service(s) preventing the sending of notifications to
    the hosts or the dependent services
-   The **Services** list defines the master service(s)
-   The **Dependent services** list defines the dependent services
-   The **Dependent hosts** list defines the dependent hosts
-   The **Comments** field can be used to comment on the dependencies

### Host groups

To configure a logical dependency, go into the
`Configuration> Notifications > Dependencies > Host Groups` menu and
click **Add**.

![image](../assets/alerts/03hostgroupdependance.png)

Two types of host group: a host group is called a master if it controls
the execution and the notification of other (“dependent”) host groups.

-   The **Name** and **Description** fields indicate the name and the
    description of the dependencies
-   The **Parent relationship** field should be ignored if you use the
    Centreon Engine. If it is enabled, and if the links of dependencies
    of the master host group become unavailable, the dependencies in the
    process of creation are no longer taken into account.
-   The **Execution Failure Criteria** field indicates the statuses of
    the master host group(s) preventing the check of the dependent host
    groups
-   The **Notification Failure Criteria** field indicates the statuses
    of the master host(s) preventing the sending of notifications to the
    dependent host groups
-   The **Host groups name** list defines the master host group(s)
-   The **Dependent host group name** list defines the dependent host
    group(s)
-   The **Comments** field can be used to comment on the dependencies

### Service groups

To configure a logical dependency, go into the
`Configuration> Notifications > Dependencies > Service Groups` menu and
click **Add**.

![image](../assets/alerts/03servicegroupdependance.png)

Two types of service group: a service group is called a “master” if it
controls the execution and the notification of other (“dependent”)
service groups.

-   The **Name** and **Description** fields indicate the name and the
    description of the dependencies
-   The **Parent relationship** field should be ignored if you use the
    Centreon Engine. If it is enabled, and if the links of dependencies
    of the master service group become unavailable, the dependencies in
    the creation process are no longer taken into account.
-   The **Execution Failure Criteria** field indicates the statuses of
    the master service group(s) preventing the check of the dependent
    service groups
-   The **Notification Failure Criteria** field indicates the statuses
    of the master host(s) preventing the sending of notifications to the
    dependent service groups
-   The **Service group names** list defines the group(s) of master
    services
-   The **Dependent service group names** list defines the group(s) of
    dependent services
-   The **Comments** field can be used to comment on the dependencies

### Meta-services

To configure a logical dependency, go into the
`Configuration> Notifications > Dependencies > Meta Services` menu and
click **Add**.

![image](../assets/alerts/03metaservicedependance.png)

Two types of meta-service: a meta-service is called a “master” if it
controls the execution and the notification of other (“dependent”)
meta-services.

-   The **Name** and **Description** fields indicate the name and
    description of the dependencies
-   The **Parent relationship** field should be ignored if you use the
    Centreon Engine. If it is enabled, and if the links of dependencies
    of the master meta-service become unavailable, the dependencies in
    the creation process are no longer taken into account.
-   The **Execution Failure Criteria** field Indicates the
    statuses of the meta-master service(s) that will prevent the check
    of the meta-dependent services
-   The **Notification Failure Criteria** field indicates the statuses
    of the meta-service(s) preventing the sending of notifications to
    meta-dependent services
-   The **Meta-service name** list defines the master meta-service(s)
-   The **Dependent meta-service** names list defines the dependent
    meta-service(s)
-   The **Comments** field can be used to comment on the dependencies

## Examples

This sub-chapter illustrates the use of these dependencies via a few
actual cases.

> The dependencies are based on failure criteria in the form of “do not do if”.
> Do not notify if the service is in a Critical state. Do not perform
> the check if the service is in a Critical, Alert, Unknown, … state.

### Services dependencies

A service is checked using a Selenium scenario. This scenario connects
to a web interface with an identifier and a password. This connection
information is stored in a MariaDB database.

Consequently, if the database server does not reply, the Selenium
scenario cannot be completed. It seems obvious that it is necessary to
create a logical dependency link between the service that uses the
Selenium scenario and the service that is responsible for checking the
status of the MariaDB server.

Moreover, considering that the Selenium scenario cannot perform
properly, no performance data can be stored in the database. So, it is
necessary not only to stop the notification for the service using the
Selenium scenario, but also the check.

To create this dependency, go into the
`Configuration> Notifications > Dependencies > Services` menu and click
**Add**.

1.  Enter the name and the description of the dependency
2.  For the **Execution Failure Criteria** and **Notification Failure
    Criteria** fields, check Warning, Critical, Unknown and Pending
3.  In the **Services** list, select the service that is responsible for
    checking the status of the MariaDB server
4.  In the **Dependent Services** list, select the service that uses the
    Selenium scenario
5.  Save

From now on, if the service responsible for checking the status of the
MariaDB server has “Warning”, “Critical”, “Unknown” or “Pending” status,
the service responsible for executing the Selenium scenario will not be
executed until the master recovers its OK status.

### Hosts dependencies

Let us take the case of two hosts that operate as a cluster. Three
hosts are created to be able to monitor this cluster: a host A, a host B
(both members of the cluster) and a host C (which centralizes the
information from the cluster).

If host A or host B has a Not-OK status, the services of host C will
automatically be considered to be Not-OK. So, it is necessary to add a
dependency that prevents the sending of notifications if host A or host
B becomes faulty. However, performance data feedback must always be
operational; this is why it is necessary to continue the monitoring of
host C.

To create this dependency, go into the
`Configuration> Notifications > Dependencies > Hosts` menu and click
**Add**.

1.  Enter the name and the description of the dependency
2.  For the **Notification Failure Criteria** field, check Warning,
    Critical, Unknown and Pending
3.  In the **Host Names** list, select host A
4.  In the **Dependent Host Names** list, select host C
5.  Save.

Repeat this operation for host B.

### Service Groups dependencies

Let us take the example of a set of Oracle services on which the ERP
application bases itself. Two service groups are needed:

-   The Oracle Application group
-   The ERP Application group

If the Oracle services become critical, the services of the ERP
application are automatically critical. It is necessary to create a
dependency link to prevent the check and notification of the services of
the application ERP if the Oracle application is Not-OK.

To create this dependency, go into the
`Configuration> Notifications > Dependencies > Service Groups` menu and
click **Add**.

1.  Enter the name and the description of the dependency
2.  For the **Execution Failure Criteria** and **Notification Failure
    Criteria** fields, check Critical and Pending
3.  In the **Service Group Names** list, select the service group Oracle
    Application
4.  In the **Dependent Service Group Names** list, select the service
    group ERP Application
5.  Save
