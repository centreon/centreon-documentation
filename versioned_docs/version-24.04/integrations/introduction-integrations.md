## Introduction to third-party integrations

Centreon provides numerous ways to cooperate with third-party tools to guarantee 
a perfect integration within your IT ecosystem.

Integrations rely on various modules and features to make Centreon compliant with 
your data, alerts, events, or metrics management processes: 

- [Centreon Stream Connector](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-stream-connector-scripts), 
get the capability to send event and metrics to a third-party tool. They help you to get maximum 
insights from your monitoring data while seamlessly integrating with your existing processes thanks 
to advanced filtering and formatting capabilities.

- [Centreon Open Ticket](../alerts-notifications/ticketing.md) 
extension introduces additional UI actions and backend boiler-plates to create 
cases within your favorite ticketing system. 

This documentation is organized to guide you to the right integration depending upon the 
feature or value-proposition you want to obtain by connecting Centreon with a third-party
solution. Here is a list of integrations domains:
