### Contact Groups

Contact Groups are used to notify contacts:

* In the definition of a host or a service
* In the definition of an escalation of notifications

In addition, the groups of contacts are also used during the definition of an [access group](../../administration/access-control-lists.md#creating-an-access-group).

Consequently, it is necessary to group contacts together in a logical way. Most of the time, they are grouped together
according to their roles in the information systems. e.g.: DSI, Windows Administrators, Linux Administrators, Person
in charge of the Salary Management application, etc.

## Creating a contact group

Go to the **Configuration > Users > Contact Groups** menu and click **Add**

* The **Contact Group Name** and **Alias** fields define the name and the description of the contact group.
* The **Linked Contacts** list allows us to add contacts to the contact group.
* The **Status** and **Comment** fields are used to enable or disable the group of contacts and to make comments on it.
