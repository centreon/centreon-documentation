> [Plugin Packs installation](../../monitoring/pluginpacks).

A Plugin Pack is a downloadable package containing a set of configuration
templates that make it fast and easy to monitor your IT infrastructure.

The templates (commands, hosts and services templates) configure a monitoring
plugin that actually executes the monitoring commands on a Centreon Poller.
Plugins are not packaged with Plugin Packs and must be installed separately:
this is explained in the monitoring procedure that comes with each Plugin Pack.
Some Plugin Packs also require a Connector (e.g. AS400, VMWare) or an agent
(e.g. Windows NRPE).

For each type of equipment, the templates determine which indicators will be
monitored and set default warning and critical thresholds. These may be
fine-tuned later-on.

Some Plugin Packs also contain discovery rules. Discovery rules instruct the
Centreon discovery engine to fetch additional assets to be monitored. Host
discovery rules will look for new hosts (e.g. EC2 assets on AWS, virtual
machines on VMware) while Service discovery rules will look for new services
(e.g. Disk Volumes or Ethernet Interfaces on a server).

Plugin Packs on your Centreon platform are managed by the Plugin Pack Manager
user interface. Plugin Packs may be updated or new Plugin Packs may be added to
the Centreon online library on a weekly basis. These are accessed from the
Plugin Pack Manager.

To learn more about how to use Plugin Packs, refer to the Monitoring/Plugin
Packs chapter of the documentation.

This chapter contains an up-to-date list of all Plugin Packs with their
respective monitoring procedure. They are organized in 14 categories
(Applications, Centreon, Cloud, Database, Hardware, Network, Operating System,
Protocol, Sensor, Storage, ToIP-VoIP, UPS-PDU, Virtualization) and then listed
alphabetically. The search function of your browser is your friend\!
