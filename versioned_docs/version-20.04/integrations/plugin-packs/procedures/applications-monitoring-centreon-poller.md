## Prerequisites

### Centreon Plugin

Install this plugin on each needed poller:

``` shell
yum install centreon-plugin-Applications-Monitoring-Centreon-Poller centreon-plugin-Operatingsystems-Linux-Snmp
```

## SNMP

Connect to your Central and configure SNMP.

## SSH key copy

Pollers are supposed to be monitored by the Central server.

To do so, we will use centreon user SSH key \# cp
/var/spool/centreon/.ssh/id\_rsa /var/lib/centreon-engine/.ssh/ \# chown
centreon-engine. /var/lib/centreon-engine/.ssh/id\_rsa
