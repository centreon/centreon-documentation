title: Install Centreon BAM extension
---

> Centreon BAM is a Centreon **extension** that requires a valid license key. To
> purchase one, contact
> [Centreon](mailto:sales@centreon.com).

## Prerequisites

Install BAM on the central server.
The central server and Centreon BAM must be installed in the same major versions (i.e. both in 22.10.x).
If you want to be able to view the Business activities monitored by a remote server, install BAM on the remote server too. When BAM is installed on a remote server, the Business activities will only include the resources monitored by the remote server.

## Installation

### Install the package

Add the Centreon BAM repository, you can find it on the 
[support portal](https://support.centreon.com/hc/en-us/categories/10341239833105-Repositories).

And install the package using the following command:

``` shell
yum install centreon-bam-server
```

### Upload the license

A license file *bam.license* is provided by Centreon. Go to
**Administration > Extensions > Manager** and upload the license
using the interface.

### Install the interface

Go to the **Administration > Extension > Manager** menu and click on the install
button for the following modules:

- License Manager (if not yet installed)
- Business Activity Monitoring

Once installed and the license added, the module will have a green banner that indicates
the license expiry date:

>
> Create the view manually on the slave server by executing the
> following command line:
