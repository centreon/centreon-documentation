2. Add  [macros](./config/macros.md) for hosts and services 
3. Define [w√≠dgets](./config/widgets.md) for the interface

### Advanced configuration

Things that you may need to adapt include:

* Defining [custom lists](./advanced/list-definition.md) to show when creating a ticket.
* Chaining [rules](./advanced/rules.md) to perform actions (e.g. sending an email) when a ticket is created.
* Adding [commands](./advanced/commands.md) to be performed when a ticket is created.
