## How it works

The Jira provider connects to your Itop server and retrieve data through the
Jira REST API.

![architecture](../../assets/integrations/open-tickets/ot-jira-architecture.png)

## Compatibility

This integration is (at least) compatible with Jira cloud

## Requirements

Before going any further, make sure that you correctly setup
[centreon-open-ticket](../../alerts-notifications/ticketing-install.md)
into your Centreon instance

Our provider requires the following parameters:

| Parameter         | Example of value    |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Address           | xxxxx.atlassian.net |
| Rest Api Resource | /rest/api/latest/   |
| Username          | MyUser              |
| Password          | MyPassword          |
| Timeout           | 60                  |

## Possibilities

As of now, the provider is able to retrieve the following objects from Jira:

  - Project
  - Priority
  - Assignee
  - Issue type
