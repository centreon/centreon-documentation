We have included a set of generic reports that you can reconfigure for your
environment based on Centreon concepts (e.g., business activities, host groups
and categories, service categories, metrics).

> You can have a look at our [Reports
> book](../../../assets/en/reporting/Centreon-MBI-Sample-Reports.pdf) to find the
> report you need before consulting this report guide.

Most of these reports have been designed to be perfectly rendered in
PDF. The space reserved for object names (host, services, groups,
categories) in tables or graph legends may sometimes be limited, so
please remember to define objects' names accordingly.

#### Description

This report allows you to identify hosts responsible for the largest
number of exception events in a host group. The data is represented in a
Pareto chart.

#### How to interpret the report

Hosts responsible for 80% of events are highlighted. Hosts are sorted in
descending order in terms of number of generated events. The ratio of
cumulative events is also shown.

This report helps you to focus on the most problematic hosts by applying
the Pareto principle (or 80-20 rule): approximately 80% of the effects
come from 20% of the causes.

#### Prerequisites

Go to `Reporting > Business Intelligence > General Options > Scheduler Options`
and configure the following field:

![image](../assets/reporting/guide/available-reports/graph_url.png)

In order to export RRD graphs using the Centreon API, the reporting
server needs to access it using HTTP or HTTPS protocole. A curl command
sent to the URL of the API should generate an image file.

``` shell
curl http://$CENTREON-IP-OR-DNS$/centreon/include/views/graphs/generateGraphs/generateImage.php?akey=$AUTH_KEY$&username=$USER$&hostname=$HOSTNAME$&service=$SERVICENAME$&start=$TIMESTAMPSTART$&end=$TIMESTAMPEND$
```

Replace the values between $ signs by real values.

Example:

``` shell
curl http://centreon.enterprise.com/centreon/include/views/graphs/generateGraphs/generateImage.php?akey=af9c583c5f31bd2459c07&username=myUser&hostname=host-1&service=cpu&start=1490997600&end=1493157600
```

> If you are using SSL/TLS on your Central server, and if the certificate is
> self-signed or signed by an unknown authority, you must add it to the trusted
> certificates database:
>
> - Install *ca-certificates* package:
>
>   ``` shell
>   yum install -y ca-certificates
>   ```
>
> - Retrieve and store certificate:
>
>   ``` shell
>   echo quit | openssl s_client -showcerts -servername <hostname> -connect <hostname>:<port> > /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/<hostname>.pem
>   ```
>
>   The *servername* option value must be the exact hostname defined in the
>   certificate. It must also be the hostname defined in Centreon Web
>   configuration, and used by the reports scheduler to contact the Central
>   server.
>
> - Reload the trusted certificates database:
>
>   ```shell

#### Prerequisites

This report is developed for full compatibility with the plugin pack
Virt-VMware2-ESX and the Centreon-VMWare-2.0 connector. The following
prerequisites for the proper generation of the report shall apply.

Implement monitoring of the following indicators:

- CPU service, a memory service and a VM Count service for each ESX.
- Datastore-usage service for each datastore, or for all datastores,
  linked to the vCenter or to only one ESX of the cluster. By
  default, the service will have the following nomenclature:
  Datastore-Usage-xxxx (xxxx is the datastore name).
- Datastore-IOPS service for each datastore or for all datastores,
  linked to the vCenter or to only on ESX of the cluster. By
  default, the service will have the following nomenclature:
  Datastore-Iops-xxxx (xxxx is the datastore name).

Create host groups that correspond to the clusters. A cluster (host
group) contains:

- Several ESXs (hosts).
- The vCenter, only if Datastore-usage and Datastore-IOPS services are linked to
  the vCenter and not to one cluster's ESX.

Create at least one host category containing the whole cluster (vCenter + ESXs).
If there are multiple ESX clusters, you can split them into several host
categories to filter the report on a single cluster.

Create the following service categories:

- CPU-ESX: combines all CPU indicators on ESXs.
- Memory-ESX: combines all memory indicators on ESXs.
- VMcount-ESX: combines all VM Count indicators on ESXs.
- Datastore-usage: combines all datastore usage indicators.
- Datastore-IOPS: combines all datastore IOPS indicators.

> If a datastore or an ESX host name contains more than 16 characters, only the
> first 16 will be shown, supplemented by 3 dots.

## Report translation

Centreon MBI can generate reports in two languages: English and French.
Other target languages are possible if you create the appropriate
translation files.

Translation files require a .properties extension. They are stored in
the */usr/share/centreon-bi/Resources/translation* directory and
classified by type in subdirectories.

The English-language files are named *xxx.properties* and the French,
*xxx\_fr\_FR.properties*.

If you need to generate reports in a language other than English or
French, you should make a copy of all *xxx.properties*, giving the files
a suffix corresponding to the locale of your target language.

For example, a German translation requires the file with the suffix
*xxx\_de\_DE.properties*; for a Spanish translation it would be
*xxx\_es\_ES.properties*.

Then, translate all the English content in these new files into the
appropriate target language.

> Even if you want to translate only a few reports, you still have to
> translate the global translation files using the method described above.
> These files are:
>
> - units.properties
> - calendar.properties
> - common.properties
> - master-page.properties

Then translate the file or files for the report family you require.
These files are stored in
`/usr/share/centreon-bi/Resources/translation/component/`.

When the new *xxx.properties* files have been translated, go to your Centreon
MBI interface, edit a job then click on the refresh button next to the language
selection. The new language should appear in the list.

Select the desired language and generate the report.

> **Warning**
>
> Because certain languages are more verbose than others, translated text
> strings that are excessively long may affect the formatting (design) of
> the report.
