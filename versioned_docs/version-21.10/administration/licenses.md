## How can I obtain a license?

* You can request your token for the [free IT-100 edition](../getting-started/it100.md) on our website.
* If you have purchased a license, request your license files from our [support](https://support.centreon.com) team.

## Types of licenses

According to your [Centreon edition](https://www.centreon.com/en/editions/), your license can be:
- offline: uses one or several license files
- online: uses a token. Your Centreon platform must be connected to the internet.

## Which modules require a license?

The following modules need to be installed separately and require a valid license.

- [Plugin Packs](../monitoring/pluginpacks.md#installation)
- [Auto Discovery](../monitoring/discovery/installation.md)
- [Anomaly Detection](../monitoring/anomaly-detection.md)
- [Service mapping (BAM)](../service-mapping/install.md)
- [Graphical views (MAP)](../graph-views/install.md)
- [Reporting (MBI)](../reporting/installation.md)

## Viewing license-based modules

Go to **Administration > Extensions > Manager**. All modules currently installed on your platform have a green button with a white tick mark in it. Modules that require a license have a colored banner at the bottom (red if you have no valid license, green if you have one).

To use an online license, your Centreon platform must be connected to the internet.

#### Check the connection to internet

Make sure your Centreon platform is allowed to reach the internet:

- Check that the machine can access this URL: https://api.imp.centreon.com

- If needed, set a proxy server:
  - Go to the **Administration > Parameters > Centreon UI** page, then **Proxy options** section.
  - Click on **Test Internet Connection**. The "Connection Successful" message should appear.

#### Add your license

1. Make sure you have your license token (provided by our support team).

2. Go to **Administration > Extensions > Manager**.

3. Click on **Add Token**. A popup window appears.

4. Paste your token in the popup window, then click on **Add**.

    - If your token contains one license, a confirmation message appears.

    - If your token contains several licenses, choose the license you want and then click on **Choose**. 

    Press **Esc** to close the popup window. The license is applied and the corresponding modules display their validity date:

## Free IT-100 license

See chapter [Set up your free IT-100 solution](../getting-started/it100.md).

## Troubleshooting

### No valid file uploaded

![image](../assets/administration/license_not_valid.png)

Check the contents of the following directory:

```shell
ls -lah /etc/centreon/license.d/
```

If the directory already contains licences with rights that are not apache/apache, delete them or change their rights so that they can be overwritten by the new licenses:

```shell
chown apache:apache /etc/centreon/license.d/*
chmod 640 /etc/centreon/license.d/*
```

### Your EPP license is not valid

* Check that the fingerprint of the central server (on page **Administration > Extensions > Manager**) matches the fingerprint in the license.

    ```shell
    less /etc/centreon/license.d/epp.license
    ```

* Check that you do not have more hosts than your license allows. To know the total number of hosts you are supervising, go to **Configuration > Hosts > Hosts**, and then use the dropdown list to the right above the list of hosts:

    ![image](../assets/administration/number-of-hosts.png)

    You can also use the following command:

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM centreon.host WHERE host_register='1';
    ```
