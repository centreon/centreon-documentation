## Definition

A command is the definition of a line of command which uses a script or an application to perform an action. It is
possible execute this command by specifying arguments.

There are four types of command:

* **Verification** commands are used by the schedulers to verify the status of a host or of a service.
* **Notification** commands are used by the schedulers to alert the contacts (via mail, SMS, etc.).
* **Discovery** commands are used by the schedulers to discover.
* **Miscellaneous** commands are used by the additional modules (to perform certain actions), by the scheduler for
  data processing, etc.

All the commands can be configured in the menu: **Configuration > Commands**.

> By default, locked commands are hidden. Check the "Locked elements" box to list all commands.

## Adding a command

1. Go to the **Configuration > Commands** menu
2. Click on **Add**

![image](../../assets/configuration/04command.png)

> The configuration fields of a command are the same regardless of the type of command chosen.

## Configuration fields

* The **command Name** field defined the name of the command.
* The **Command Type** field allows us to choose the type of command.
* The **Command Line** field indicates the application or the script use with the command.
* The **Enable shell** box allows us to enable functions that are specific to a shell such as the pipe, etc.
* The **Argument Example** field define examples of arguments (each argument starts with a ”!”)
* The **Describe arguments** button serves to add  a description to arguments of the “$ARGn$” type. This description
  will be visible when using the command in a host or service form.
* The **Clear arguments** button deletes the description of arguments defined
* The **Describe macros** button serves to add  a description to all macros. This description will be visible when
  using the command in a host or service form.
* The **Connectors** selectlist serves to link a Connector to the command. For more information on Connectors refer to the
  chapter entitled *[Perl Connector](#perl-connector)* and *[SSH Connector](#ssh-connector)*.
* The **Graph template** field serves to link the command to a graphic model.
* The **Comment** field can be used to make a comment on the command.

## Arguments and macros

In the **Command Line** field it is possible to use *[macros](macros.md)* and arguments.

The macros are used to be able to pass various settings to the scripts called up by the commands. During execution
of the command by the scheduler, each of the arguments and macros are replaced by their respective values.
Each macro appears in the form **$value$**:

```shell
$CENTREONPLUGINS$/centreon_linux_snmp.pl --plugin=os::linux::snmp::plugin --mode=cpu \
--hostname=$HOSTADDRESS$ --snmp-version='$_HOSTSNMPVERSION$' \
--snmp-community='$_HOSTSNMPCOMMUNITY$' $_HOSTSNMPEXTRAOPTIONS$ \
--warning-average='$_SERVICEWARNING$' \
--critical-average='$_SERVICECRITICAL$' $_SERVICEEXTRAOPTIONS$
```

> Good practice requires replacing the arguments by *[custom macros](macros.md#custom-macros)*.

## Connectors

##### Build

###### Get sources

Centreon SSH Connector can be checked out from *[GitHub](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-connectors)*.
The SSH connector sources reside in the ssh subdirectory. On a Linux box with git installed this is just a matter of:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/centreon/centreon-connectors
```

###### Configuration

At the root of the project directory you'll find a ssh/build directory which holds build scripts. Generate the Makefile
by running the following command:

```shell
cd /path_to_centreon_connector/ssh/build
```

Your Centreon SSH Connector can be tweaked to your particular needs using CMake's variable system. Variables can be set
like this:

```shell
cmake -D<variable1>=<value1> [-D<variable2>=<value2>] .
```

Here's the list of variables available and their description:

| Variable                           | Description                                                                                                                                | Default value        |

appropriate error message will be printed. Otherwise an installation summary will be printed.

> If you need to change the options you used to compile your software, you might want to remove the *CMakeCache.txt*
> file that is in the *build* directory. This will remove cache entries that might have been computed during the last
> configuration step.

###### Compilation

Once properly configured, the compilation process is really simple:

```shell
make
```

And wait until compilation completes.

###### Install

Once compiled, the following command must be run as privileged user to finish installation:

```shell
make install
```

And wait for its completion.

#### Configuration

Centreon SSH Connector itself does not require any configuration. It
should only be configured as a connector of Centreon Engine.

To execute SSH check over SSH with Centreon SSH Connector from Centreon
Engine, one might configure commands that relates to SSH check
(like check_by_ssh).

##### Binary arguments

Here are the supported arguments for `centreon_connector_ssh`:

    connector centreon_connector_ssh
}
```

##### Technical details

This article describes how Centreon SSH Connector allow much gain on SSH check execution.

One major CPU-intensive and long operation in a SSH environment is the key exchange and verification mechanism. This
operation occurs when a SSH session is started between two hosts. After this step all exchange operations are using far
less resources.

Centreon SSH Connector take advantage of this fact and maintain semi-permanent connection with hosts to which it had to
connect to. This way if multiple checks are performed on the same host, where "check_by_ssh" opens one session for each
check, Centreon Connector SSH only opens one session. However this does not limit the number of concurrent checks on a
host, as the SSH protocol allows multiple channels to be opened on the same session. Therefore if multiple checks are
run on the same host simultaneously, they are executed concurrently but with separate execution environment.

### Perl connector

Centreon Perl Connector is a free software from Centreon available under the Apache Software License version 2 (ASL 2.0).
It speeds up execution of Perl scripts when used along Centreon Engine.

#### Installation

Centreon recommends using its official packages. Most of Centreon’ endorsed software are available as RPM packages.

Run the following commands as privileged user:

```shell
yum install centreon-connector-perl
```

Or you can build the Centreon SSH Connector. You will need the following external dependencies:

* a C++ compilation environment.
* CMake **(>= 2.8)**, a cross-platform build system.
* Centreon Clib, The centreon Core library.
* ssh2 library to use ssh functions.
* gcrypt library to secure connections.

##### Build

###### Get sources

Centreon Perl Connector can be checked out from [GitHub](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-connectors).
The Perl connector sources reside in the perl subdirectory. On a Linux box with git installed this is just a matter of:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/centreon/centreon-connectors
```

###### Configuration

At the root of the project directory you'll find a perl/build directory which holds build scripts. Generate the Makefile
by running the following command:

```shell
cd /path_to_centreon_connector/perl/build
```

Your Centreon Perl Connector can be tweaked to your particular needs using CMake's variable system. Variables can be set
like this:

```shell
cmake -D<variable1>=<value1> [-D<variable2>=<value2>] .
```

Here's the list of variables available and their description:

| Variable                           | Description                                                                                                                                 | Default value        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| WITH\_CENTREON\_CLIB\_INCLUDE\_DIR | Set the directory path of centreon-clib include.                                                                                            | auto detection       |
| WITH\_CENTREON\_CLIB\_LIBRARIES    | Set the centreon-clib library to use.                                                                                                       | auto detection       |
| WITH\_CENTREON\_CLIB\_LIBRARY\_DIR | Set the centreon-clib library directory (don't use it if you use WITH\_CENTREON\_CLIB\_LIBRARIES)                                           | auto detection       |
| WITH\_PREFIX                       | Base directory for Centreon PErl Connector installation. If other prefixes are expressed as relative paths, they are relative to this path. | `/usr/local`         |
| WITH\_PREFIX\_BINARY               | Define specific directory for Centreon Connector Perl binary.                                                                               | `${WITH_PREFIX}/bin` |
| WITH\_TESTING                      | Enable generation of unit tests. They can later be run by typing *make test*.                                                               | OFF                  |

Example

```shell
cmake \
    -DWITH_PREFIX=/usr \
    -DWITH_PREFIX_BINARY=/usr/lib/centreon-connector \
    -DWITH_TESTING=0 .
```

At this step, the software will check for existence and usability of the rerequisites. If one cannot be found, an
appropriate error message will be printed. Otherwise an installation summary will be printed.

> If you need to change the options you used to compile your software, you might want to remove the *CMakeCache.txt*
> file that is in the *build* directory. This will remove cache entries that might have been computed during the last
> configuration step.

###### Compilation

Once properly configured, the compilation process is really simple:

```shell
make
```

And wait until compilation completes.

###### Install

Once compiled, the following command must be run as privileged user to finish installation:

```shell
make install
```

And wait for its completion.

#### Configuration

Centreon Perl Connector itself does not require any configuration. It should only be configured as a connector of
Centreon Engine.

To execute Perl scripts with Centreon Perl Connector from Centreon Engine, one might configure commands that relates to
Perl scripts. Such commands must only contain the path to the Perl script to execute followed by its arguments, just
like one would on the command line. To make it simple, you just have to add a connector property to your command
definition.

##### Binary arguments

Here are the supported arguments for `centreon_connector_perl`:

| Short name | Long name   | Description                                                                   |
| ---------- | ----------  | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \-d        | \--debug    | If this flag is specified, print all logs messages.                           |
| \-h        | \--help     | Print help and exit.                                                          |
| \-v        | \--version  | Print software version and exit.                                              |
| \-c        | \--code     | Argument is some Perl code that will be executed by the embedded interpreter. |
| \-l        | \--log-file | Specifies the log file (default: stderr).                                     |

Example:

```shell
define connector{
    connector_name centreon_connector_perl
    connector_line /usr/lib64/centreon-connector/centreon_connector_perl --log-file=/var/log/centreon-engine/centreon-connector-perl.log
}

define command{
    command_name check_ping
    command_line $USER1$/check_ping.pl -H $HOSTADDRESS$
    connector centreon_connector_perl
}

define command{
    command_name check_disk
    command_line $USER1$/check_disk.pl -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -D $ARG1$
    connector centreon_connector_perl
}
```

##### Technical details

This article describes how Centreon Perl Connector allow much gain on Perl script execution.

First of all let's examine how a Perl script is executed traditionnally by Centreon Engine.

* Centreon Engine forks, creating a new separate process.
* This new process executes the execve syscall to run the Perl interpreter. This step does not create a new process.
* The Perl interpreter parse the Perl script.
* Perl script get executed.

With Centreon Engine, the same script get executed multiple times but with different arguments. Therefore we took
advantage of this fact to efficiently parse all the scripts once and get them executed. This was only possible because
of the fork()ing system of Unix-like platform. If you read the reference page on Wikipedia you indeed remarked that
once fork()ed the old and the new process are identical. Centreon Connector Perl's steps to execute scripts are as
follow.

* Centreon Engine creates a resident process of Centreon Connector Perl once
* For all Perl scripts execution requests are forwarded to this process when requested to execute a script, Centreon
  Perl Connector checks if this script has already been parsed if not it parses it using the Embedded Perl interpreter.
* Centreon Perl Connector forks itself.
* The precompiled script gets executed

This way Perl scripts are only parsed once during the lifetime of the monitoring engine. This heavily relates to
*[prepared statements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statements)* in SQL.
