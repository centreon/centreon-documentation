This topic lists known issues the MAP team is currently working on:

- In the MAP editor, you are not able to set properties on graphs.
- You are not able to customize your elements with font properties.
- When migrating Geo Maps (standard maps with a geographical background using a tile provider such as MapBox), these map objects will be migrated, but tiles will not appear in the background.
- The ability to change language is not yet implemented in the interface.
- Curve colors for line charts are constantly changing.
