In Centreon, users can:

- Receive [notifications](../../alerts-notifications/notif-configuration.md).
- Log in to the Centreon web interface: each user has their own [rights](../../administration/access-control-lists.md) to connect to the web interface.
- [Customize the use of Centreon](../../getting-started/interface.md):
  - Switch to dark mode.
  - Change the user interface language.
  - Reset the password.
  - Define a default page after login.

Use these procedures to manage users:
- [Create users manually](contacts-create.md).
- [Connect your Centreon to an LDAP directory](../../administration/parameters/ldap.md).
