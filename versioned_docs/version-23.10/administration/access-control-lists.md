title: Granting rights to Centreon users (ACL)
---

You can grant rights to Centreon [users](../monitoring/basic-objects/contacts.md):

- on resources: which hosts, services, etc. users will be allowed to see
- on the menus in the Centreon interface (which pages users will be able to access)
- on actions users will be allowed to carry out, on resources or on a monitoring engine (planning downtime, exporting the configuration, etc.).

Rights are not defined at user level, but through [access groups](#creating-an-access-group).

- A specific user can belong to several access groups, and the rights defined in each group will be combined.
- Non-administrator users that belong to no access group will have no rights at all on the monitoring platform (empty screen at login)
- [Administrator](../monitoring/basic-objects/contacts-create.md#centreon-authentication) users have all rights (even if you add an administrator to an access group with limited rights).

ACLs are recalculated every minute; this is why it is sometimes necessary
to wait a few seconds before changes are applied to a user. You can also [reload them](#reload-acl) manually.

> The Centreon [MBI](../reporting/configure.md), BAM and [MAP](../graph-views/configuration.md) modules have their own ACLs.

## Granting rights to a user

To grant rights to a user:

1. [Create the user](../monitoring/basic-objects/contacts.md) in Centreon.

2. [Create an access group](#creating-an-access-group).

3. Add the user to the access group.

4. Create access filters on [resources](#access-filters-on-resources), [menus](#access-filters-on-menus) and [actions](#access-filters-on-actions).

5. Set the rights you want:
    - either on the access group
    - or on the access filters on resources, menus and actions.

## Creating an access group

To create an access group:

1. Go to **Administration > ACL > Access groups** and then click **Add**.

2. On the **Group information** tab, enter a name and an alias (a description) for the group.

3. To add users (contacts) or contact groups to the access group, use the **Linked Contacts/Linked Contact Groups** table. (Select the user(s) you want in the **Available** column, and then click **Add**. The user(s) is moved to the **Selected** column.)

    > The contact group can come from the LDAP directory connected to the
    > Centreon interface.
    >
    > To avoid problems, groups created in the Centreon interface should not have the same name as LDAP
    > groups.

4. On the **Authorizations information** tab, set the rights you want on the access group
by choosing access filters on [resources](#access-filters-on-resources), [menus](#access-filters-on-menus) and [actions](#access-filters-on-actions) (if you have already created them).

5. Click **Save**.

## Creating access filters on resources, menus and actions

### Access filters on resources

The access filters on resources allow you to define which objects (hosts, host groups, services and service groups) users will be able to see in the Centreon interface.

To create an access filter on resources:

1. Go to **Administration > ACL > Resources Access**.

2. Click  **Add**.

3. Fill in the fields you want (see table below).

4. Click **Save**.

> Once the filters on the resources are defined, you can view the results
> using the **Check User View** button on page **Administration > ACL > Resources Access**.

| **General Information** | <ul> <li>Use the **Linked groups** table to link access groups to the filter on resources, i.e. grant the rights defined in the filter to the access group.</li><li>**Status** and **Comments** allow you to enable/disable the filter or to add comments to it.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Hosts Resources**    | <ul><li>Define which hosts and hosts groups users will be able to see in the Centreon interface.</li><li>If **Include all hosts** or **Include all hostgroups** is selected, any newly created host or host group will be added to the filter automatically.</li><li>Adding a host automatically includes all its services. More services can be added after this but already included services can not be excluded.</li></ul>   <p>When **Include all hosts** or **Include all hostgroups** is selected, you can explicitly exclude hosts from the filter (e.g. when only 1 or 2 hosts should not be included in the filter). </p>
| **Services resources** | The **Services resources** tab allows you to define which service groups users will be allowed to see.                                                                                                                             |
| **Meta Services**       | The **Meta Services** tab allows you to define which meta services users will be able to see.                                                                                                                             |
| **Filters**                | <ul><li>The **Poller Filter** table allows you to select hosts monitored by a specific monitoring engine (if no poller is selected, then all pollers are taken into account)</li><li>The **Host Category Filter** table allows you to filter the hosts by category</li><li>The **Service Category Filter** table allows you to filter services by category. Filters by poller or by category of objects are inclusion filters (UNION). Only the objects belonging to these filters in addition to groups of objects (hosts and services) will be visible.</li></ul> |

### Access filters on menus

Access filters on menus allow you to define which pages in the Centreon interface users will be able to access.

> Accessing the command editing menu as well as accessing the SNMP trap editing
> menu can be very dangerous. This is because privileged users can create commands,
> which may lead to the creation of security breaches (RCE). Only give this access
> to people you trust.

To create an access filter on menus:

1. Go to **Administration > ACL > Menus Access**.

2. Click **Add**.

3. Complete the following fields:
    - **ACL Definition** (its name) and **Alias**
    - **Status**: enable or disable the filter
    - **Comments**: add info about the filter.

4. To grant access groups the rights defined in this filter, use the **Linked groups** table.

5. In the **Accessible pages** section, define which menus the access group will be able to access.

   - A parent menu must be selected to access the child menu.
   - By default, access is **Read Only**. If you want to allow your users to modify
the configuration, select the **Read / Write** option for each
submenu.
   - To access an ‘n-1’ menu level, users must have access to the ‘n’ menu level,
 otherwise they will not be able to view the menu via the interface. If this is not
the case, users will have to access the page via a direct link
 (autologin, etc.).
    - Whenever a new Centreon module is created with a web interface accessible
 via a new menu, it should be added to the filter so that users can
access it (if applicable).

6. Click **Save**.

### Access filters on actions

Filters on actions allow you to define which actions users will be allowed to perform
on resources (hosts and services) and on the monitoring engines.

To create an access filter on actions:

1. Go to **Administration > ACL > Actions Access**.
2. Click **Add**.

    - The **Action Name** and **Description** fields contain the name of the
    filter and its description
    - In the **Relations** section, use the **Linked Groups** table to grant access groups the rights defined in the filter.

3. Select the options you want (see tables below).

4. Click **Save**.
