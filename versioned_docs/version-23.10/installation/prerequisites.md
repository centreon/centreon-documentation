This topic gives you broad guidelines to determine the size of your platform.

## Architecture

First, use the guidelines described on the [Architectures](./architectures.md#what-kind-of-architecture-do-you-need) page to determine the type of architecture you need.

## Characteristics of the servers

* The more services you monitor, the more CPU you need.
* The space used to store collected performance data depends on several criteria:

   * Frequency of checks
   * Number of checks
   * Retention time
   * Average number of metrics per service

* The number of users simultaneously connected to the interface of the central/remote server has an impact on performance. If a large number of users will have to log in to the Centreon interface at the same time, you will need more CPU.

The following data is meant for:

* An average of 10 services per host.
* Data is collected every 5 minutes.
* The retention period is 12 months.
* Each service has on average 8 metrics.

You need to adapt the following figures to your actual values. Bear in mind that you may need to adjust the size of your platform as you add more hosts over time.

Standalone central server:

| Element                     | Value     |

| RAM                         | 4 GB      |

This is how your central server should be partitioned:

| Volume group (LVM) | File system                | Description | Size                                                     |

| vg_root | swap                       | swap | 4 GB                               |

| vg_data | /var/lib/centreon-broker   | contains broker retention files | 5 GB                               |
| vg_data | /var/lib/centreon-engine | contains engine retention files | 5 GB |
| vg_data | /var/lib/mysql (only if the DBMS is on the central server)          | database | 106 GB        |
| vg_data | /var/cache/centreon/backup | backup directory | 10 GB <p>If you perform backups, use the following characteristics: <ul><li>size of the /var/lib/mysql partition * 0,6</li><li>this size is meant for 1 full backup and 6 partial ones</li><li>this is only an estimate, size should be checked manually</li></ul></p> |
| vg_data |  | Free space (unallocated) | 5 GB |

> Your system must use LVM to manage the file system.

In some cases, you may want to set up a distributed architecture, even for fewer than 500 hosts. The poller will have the same characteristics as for up to 1,000 hosts.

| CPU  (logical core at 3 GHz) | 2 vCPU    |
| RAM                         | 2 GB      |
| HDD                         | 40 GB     |

* To handle production environments (up to 7000 services with checks every 5 minutes):

| Element                     | Value     |
| ----------------------------| --------- |
| CPU  (logical core at 3 GHz) | 4 vCPU    |
| RAM                         | 4 GB      |
| HDD                         | 40 GB     |

This is how the pollers should be partitioned:

| Volume group (LVM) | File system                | Description | Size                                                     |
|-| ----------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| | /boot | boot images | 1 GB |
|  vg_root | /                          | system root            | 20 GB                                |
| vg_root | swap                       | swap | 4 GB                               |
| vg_root | /var/log                   | contains all log files | 10 GB                                |
| vg_data | /var/lib/centreon-engine   |  | 5 GB                               |

> Your system must use LVM to manage the file system.

> The number of
