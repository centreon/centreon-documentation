> This is an older version of Centreon. We recommend you install the latest version.

This chapter describes how to install your Centreon monitoring platform.

The monitoring platform can be installed in several ways. However, **we strongly
recommend using Centreon repositories (packages) to install your
platform**. Enjoy our industrialization work during installation and update steps
of the environment. Also enjoy optimizations installed by default on the system.

Centreon can be installed from sources (tar.gz) but the work is more
complex. In addition, the installation will only be supported by the community.

Before installing Centreon:

1. Check the [compatibility](compatibility.md) (supported OSs, DBMS).
2. Choose [the type of architecture](architectures.md) that best suits your needs.
3. Check the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) (CPU resources, memory, disks, partitioning, etc...).
4. [Download Centreon](https://download.centreon.com/).
5. Finally, you can install the platform.
