## What does Centreon monitor?

Centreon allows you to monitor resources. Resources can be hosts or services:

* A **host** is any device that has an IP address and that one wishes to monitor.
For example, a physical server, a virtual machine, a temperature probe, an IP camera, a printer or a storage space. A host can have one or more associated services.
* A **service** is a check point, or indicator, to be monitored on a host.
This can be the CPU usage rate, temperature, motion detection, bandwidth usage rate, disk I/O, and so on. A service can consist of one or several [metrics](../monitoring/metrics.md).

## How does the monitoring work?

In order to collect each indicator value, monitoring plugins are used which are periodically executed by a collection engine called Centreon Engine.

## How do I see the resources being monitored?

Once hosts and services are monitored, they have a status in Centreon (e.g. **OK**, **Warning**, **Critical**...). You can keep track of any changes using the **Monitoring > Resources Status** page.

If a problem occurs (not-OK/not-UP status), [contacts/users](../monitoring/basic-objects/contacts-create.md) will be able to receive [notifications](../alerts-notifications/notif-configuration.md), within set time periods.

## What features can I use to help me monitor hosts?

In Centreon, monitoring is made easy by the following elements:

* Host templates and service templates, that allow you to define default values so as to speed up the creation of these objects.

* [Plugin Packs](../monitoring/pluginpacks.md), that provide ready-to-use host and service templates. These greatly simplify the configuration of hosts and services: for instance, all you have to do is to apply Plugin Pack templates to a host for it to be monitored.

* The autodiscovery feature for hosts and services, that allows you to get a list of new hosts and services and to add them automatically to the list of monitored resources.
