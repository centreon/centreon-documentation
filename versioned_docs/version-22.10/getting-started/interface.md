>If you have installed Centreon from a [VM](../installation/installation-of-a-central-server/using-virtual-machines.md), the default credentials are **admin/Centreon!2021**.
Otherwise, the default login is **admin** and the password is the one you have defined at [step 5 of the web installation wizard](../installation/web-and-post-installation.md#step-5-admin-information).

You are now connected to the Centreon web interface.

## Menus

* **Home** shows [custom views](create-custom-view.md).
  Your workspace may be blank for now. Once you configure customizable widgets, you will see data and charts according
  to your customization.
* **Monitoring** provides a combined view of the statuses of all monitored items in real and delayed time using logs and
  performance graphics.
* **Reporting** provides an intuitive view (using diagrams) of the evolution of monitoring over a given time period.
* **Configuration** allows you to configure all monitored items and the monitoring infrastructure.
* **Administration** lets you access your user account.

## Top banner

### Pollers section

![image](../assets/getting-started/banner_pollers.png)

The left part of the top banner shows the health of your platform in real time:

* whether all pollers are running or not: the icon becomes red when a poller has not sent data to the central server for at least 15 minutes
* whether checks are running late or not. If the icon is orange or red, this may mean that your pollers are monitoring too many resources.

Click the **pollers** icon to expand the menu. On the menu, click **Configure pollers** to access page **Configuration > Pollers > Pollers**.

### Hosts and services section (top counters)

![image](../assets/getting-started/top_counters.png)

To the right of the top banner, statistics show the number of resources that are being monitored, with a specific status:

* For hosts: number of hosts with a **Down**, **Unreachable** and **Up** status.
* For services: number of services with a **Critical**, **Warning**, **Unknown** and **OK** status.

These numbers include unconfirmed (SOFT) alerts, but do not include resources that are acknowledged or in downtime. Pending resources are shown by a blue dot on the **hosts** or **services** icons.

Click on a circle representing a status:

* Page **Monitoring > Resources status** opens.
* The page is filtered according to the type of resource and the corresponding status.

Click the **hosts** or **services** icon to expand the menu and display the details of the hosts and services.

### Switch to dark mode

When you first connect to the interface, Centreon is displayed in light mode by default.

On the banner, use the switch button to turn on the dark mode.
Next time you connect to the interface, the mode you previously selected remains on.

* Light mode

> the web interface. For more details go to  [How to translate Centreon](../developer/developer-translate-centreon.md).
