title: Introduction to the migration process
---

Migration procedures apply when your Centreon platform is installed on an unsupported OS and you wish to install it on a [supported OS](../installation/prerequisites.md#operating-systems). You need to install a new OS and a new Centreon platform, then migrate your old data to the new platform.

If you just want to switch to a newer version of Centreon and your current platform is already installed on a supported OS, use the [upgrade procedures](../upgrade/introduction.md) instead.

The following table describes various cases:

| OS | Version of Centreon | Procedure to be applied |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| CentOS 5 | 3.4 | migration |
| CentOS 6 | 3.4 | migration |
| CentOS 7 | 3.4 to 21.10 | upgrade |
| CentOS 8 | 20.10 to 21.10 | migration |
| RHEL 8 | 20.10 to 21.10 | upgrade |
| OL 8 | 20.10 to 21.10 | upgrade |
