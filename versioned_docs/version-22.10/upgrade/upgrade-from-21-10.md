title: Upgrade from Centreon 21.10
---
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

This chapter describes how to upgrade your Centreon platform from version 21.10
to version 22.10.

> When you upgrade your central server, make sure you also upgrade all your remote servers and your pollers. All servers in your architecture must have the same version of Centreon. In addition, all servers must use the same [version of the BBDO protocol](../developer/developer-broker-bbdo.md#switching-versions-of-bbdo).

> If you want to migrate your Centreon server to Oracle Linux / RHEL 8
> you need to follow the [migration procedure](../migrate/migrate-from-el-to-el.md).

## Prerequisites

### Perform a backup

Be sure that you have fully backed up your environment for the following
servers:

- Central server
- Database server

## Upgrade the Centreon Central server

### Update the Centreon repository

Run the following commands:

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8" label="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8">

```shell
dnf install -y https://packages.centreon.com/rpm-standard/22.10/el8/stable/noarch/RPMS/centreon-release-22.10-1.el8.noarch.rpm
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CentOS 7" label="CentOS 7">

```shell
yum install -y yum-utils
yum-config-manager --add-repo https://packages.centreon.com/rpm-standard/22.10/el7/centreon-22.10.repo
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> If you have an offline license, install the corresponding repository for the plugin packs.
> If you are using a Business edition, install the correct Business repository too.
> You can find the repositories on the [support portal](https://support.centreon.com/hc/en-us/categories/10341239833105-Repositories).

### Install the MariaDB repository

```shell
cd /tmp
curl -JO https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup
bash ./mariadb_repo_setup
sed -ri 's/1[0-1]\.[0-9]+/10.5/' /etc/yum.repos.d/mariadb.repo
rm -f ./mariadb_repo_setup
```

### Upgrade PHP

Centreon 22.10 uses PHP in version 8.1.

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="RHEL 8" label="RHEL 8">

You need to change the PHP stream from version 8.0 to 8.1 by executing the following commands and answering **y**
to confirm:

```shell
dnf module reset php
```

```shell
dnf module install php:remi-8.1
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CentOS 7" label="CentOS 7">

You need to enable the php 8.1 repository

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Upgrade the Centreon solution

> Make sure all users are logged out from the Centreon web interface
> before starting the upgrade procedure.

If you have installed Business extensions, update the Business repository to version 22.10.
Visit the [support portal](https://support.centreon.com/hc/en-us/categories/10341239833105-Repositories) to get its address.

Stop the Centreon Broker process:
```shell
systemctl stop cbd
```

Delete existing retention files:
```shell
rm /var/lib/centreon-broker/* -f
```

Clean yum cache:

```shell
yum clean all --enablerepo=*
```

Then upgrade all the components with the following command:

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8" label="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8">

```shell
yum update centreon\* php-pecl-gnupg
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CentOS 7" label="CentOS 7">

```shell
yum update centreon\* php-pecl-gnupg
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Accept new GPG keys from the repositories as needed.

### Update your customized Apache configuration

This section only applies if you customized your Apache configuration.

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="RHEL / Oracle Linux 8" label="RHEL / Oracle Linux 8">

When upgrading your platform, the Apache configuration file is not upgraded automatically: the new configuration file brought by the rpm does not replace the old file. You must copy the changes manually to your customized configuration file.

Run a diff between the old and the new Apache configuration files:

```shell
diff -u /etc/httpd/conf.d/10-centreon.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/10-centreon.conf.rpmnew
```

* **10-centreon.conf** (post upgrade): this file contains the custom configuration. It does not contain anthing new brought by the upgrade.
* **10-centreon.conf.rpmnew** (post upgrade): this file is provided by the rpm; it does not contain any custom configuration.

For each difference between the files, assess whether you should copy it from **10-centreon.conf.rpmnew** to **10-centreon.conf**.

Check that Apache is configured properly by running the following command:

```shell
apachectl configtest
```

The expected result is the following:

```shell
Syntax OK
```

Restart the Apache and PHP processes to take in account the new configuration:

```shell
systemctl restart php-fpm httpd
```

Then check its status:

```shell
systemctl status httpd
```

If everything is ok, you should have:

```shell

#### Customized Apache configuration: enable text compression

In order to improve page loading speed, you can activate text compression on the Apache server. It requires the **brotli** package to work. This is optional but it provides a better user experience.

Add the following code to your Apache configuration file, in both the `<VirtualHost *:80>` and `<VirtualHost *:443>` elements:

```shell
<IfModule mod_brotli.c>
    AddOutputFilterByType BROTLI_COMPRESS text/html text/plain text/xml text/css text/javascript application/javascript application/json
</IfModule>
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml text/css text/javascript application/javascript application/json
```

### Finalizing the upgrade

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8" label="Alma / RHEL / Oracle Linux 8">

Before starting the web upgrade process, reload the Apache server with the
following command:
```shell
systemctl reload httpd
```

> As the interface layout has changed in version 22.10, you need to clear your browser cache to display the new theme.

If the Centreon BAM module is installed, refer to the
[upgrade procedure](../service-mapping/upgrade.md).

### Post-upgrade actions

1. Upgrade extensions. From **Administration > Extensions > Manager**, upgrade all extensions, starting
with the following:

   - License Manager,
   - Plugin Packs Manager,
   - Auto Discovery.

   Then you can upgrade all other commercial extensions.

2. [Deploy the configuration](../monitoring/monitoring-servers/deploying-a-configuration.md).

3. Restart the processes:

    ``` shell
    systemctl restart cbd centengine centreontrapd gorgoned
    ```

## Upgrade the Remote Servers

This procedure is the same as for upgrading a Centreon Central server.

> At the end of the update, configuration should be deployed from the Central server.

## Upgrade the Pollers
