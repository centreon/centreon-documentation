title: Introduction to Centreon MAP
---

Centreon MAP is a solution fully available in the Centreon web interface while offering you the best possible experience in creating, visualizing and sharing graphical representations of your monitored infrastructure.

The difference with the MAP (Legacy) version is that MAP provides you with an edition tool fully embedded in the web interface. You do not need to install anything on your desktop. You can navigate easily between the edition mode and the view mode.

> If you already used the MAP (Legacy) version, note that you can easily import your legacy maps into the MAP interface.

## Overview

Create, customize, and visualize your maps within a single web interface.

You need first to create your logical views using the MAP editor:
