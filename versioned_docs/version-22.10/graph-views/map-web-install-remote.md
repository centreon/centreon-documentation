## Installation of Centreon MAP Web for a Centreon remote server

Installation of Centreon MAP extension on a Centreon
remote server has to be done exactly like the installation on a
central server, only configuration and uninstallation are different.

If your Centreon remote server has not been installed yet, please refer to
the following
[documentation](../installation/installation-of-a-remote-server/using-packages.md).

Then refer to the [installation procedure](map-web-install.md) to install the 2 mains components:

- The web interface.
- The server.

After that, you will have to perform the additional steps explained below, to finish
installing Centreon Map on your remote server.

## Images synchronisation **To check with Dev**

Add access to the images synchronisation page **Administration  >  Parameters  >  Images**
```shell
[root@remote ~]# mysql centreon
MariaDB [centreon]> update topology SET topology_show='1' where topology_name='Images' ;
```

## Centreon Broker configuration

Configuration of Centreon MAP for a Centreon remote server consists
in creating configuration for Centreon Broker of the Centreon remote
server **from** the central server so that, with a dedicated Centreon
Broker output on the Centreon remote server, Centreon MAP can receive
real time data directly from its Centreon remote server.

To do so, you need to modify the **Centreon Broker Master**
configuration of the **Centreon Remote poller**. Go to
**Configuration > Pollers > Broker configuration** menu and edit the
remote poller configuration.

In the **Output** tab, create a new output with the following parameters:

To finish the installation, generate, export the configuration and
**restart** Centreon Broker manually.

## Uninstalling Centreon MAP

On a remote poller, you can uninstall **Centreon MAP** module the same
way as on the Centreon central server. All Centreon Broker configuration for the Centreon remote server linked to the Centreon
MAP module have to be manually removed. Look at the [Centreon Broker configuration](#centreon-broker-configuration) section above to
know what output you need to delete for your Centreon remote server(s).
