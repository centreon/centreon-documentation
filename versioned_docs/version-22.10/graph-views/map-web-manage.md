title: Managing maps in MAP
---

This topic provides information about how to perform actions on your maps from the Centreon MAP interface. You can create two types of map:

- **Standard maps:** to visualize graphical representations of your monitored infrastructure.
- **Geographic views:** to display the resources of your IT environment across a defined geographical area.

> Options that are available in the MAP interface depend on the permissions assigned to you by your administrator. See the [Manage access rights on MAP](map-web-access.md) topic to know more about rights and permissions.

The display of the **Add a Map** button or **Add a Geographic view** button means that you are allowed to create a map and that you belong to an access group that is granted the creator role.

## Map status information

The homepage displays the list of existing maps and you can visualize for each map, the worst status of all resources or containers included in the map.

## Performing actions on a map

You can perform actions on each standard map and geographic view you have access to. Use the following procedures if you need to edit the map properties, share or delete a map.

> The features to share and to copy a map URL are not available on a geographic view.
