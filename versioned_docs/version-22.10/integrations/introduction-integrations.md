title: Introduction to third-party integrations
---

Centreon provides numerous ways to cooperate with third-party tools to guarantee
a perfect integration within your IT ecosystem.

Integrations rely on various modules and features to make Centreon compliant with
your data, alerts, events, or metrics management processes:

- [Centreon Stream Connectors](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-stream-connector-scripts) allow you to send events and metrics to a third-party tool. They help you to get maximum insights from your monitoring data while seamlessly integrating with your existing processes thanks to advanced filtering and formatting capabilities.

- The [Centreon Open Ticket](../alerts-notifications/ticketing.md)
extension introduces additional UI actions and backend boiler-plates to create
cases within your favorite ticketing system.

This documentation is organized to guide you to the right integration depending upon the 
feature or value-proposition you want to obtain by connecting Centreon with a third-party
solution. Here is a list of integrations domains:

- [Data Analytics](../integrations/data-analytics/data-analytics-overview.md)
- [Event Management](../integrations/event-management/event-management-overview.md)
- [ITSM](../integrations/itsm/itsm-overview.md)
- [Notifications](../integrations/notifications/notifications-overview.md)
