## Contributing

We value your documentation contributions, and we want to make it as easy
as possible to work in this repository. One of the first things to decide is
which branch to base your work on. If you get confused, just ask and we will
help. If a reviewer realizes you have based your work on the wrong branch, we'll
let you know so that you can rebase it.

### Pull request guidelines

Help us review your PRs more quickly by following these guidelines.

* Try not to touch a large number of files in a single PR if possible.

* Don't change whitespace or line wrapping in parts of a file you are not editing for other reasons. Make sure your text editor is not configured to automatically reformat the whole file when saving.


### Style guide

Try not to have lines over 80 characters. Use your best judgment, and try to follow the example 
set by the existing documentation.
