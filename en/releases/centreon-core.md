## Centreon Broker

### 21.04.2

#### Bugfixes

- A deadlock occasionally appears when broker is stopped right after it started
- A core dump occasionally appears when Engine is stopped

> **Known issues**
> * Broker streams: the same parameter, if used in several outputs of the same broker stream, can only have one value (the last prevails).
> * BAM: the impacts of KPIs of type Meta-service are not evaluated correctly. A fix will be release very soon.
> * BAM: the impacts of KPIs of type BA in are not evaluated correctly. A fix will be release very soon.

#### New broker logs

- New logs, with new format, epoch timestamps are replaced by real dates.

> **Warning:** you may still see timestamps in your logs until you disable the
old logs system.

```log
[2021-04-16 13:49:06.781] [core] [info] Clearing old connections
[2021-04-16 13:56:10.985] [core] [info] main: configuration update requested
```

- New log config options, with a different log level for `core`, `config`, `sql`, `processing`, `perfdata`, `bbdo`, `tcp`, `tls`, `lua`, `bam`.
- Old logs are still supported, but you are encouraged to abandon them.

#### Other enhancements

- Support of UInt64 for `id` column of `index_data` table: fixes issues on platforms having a large amount of metrics.

> **Warning:** this change needs cbd service(s) to be stopped during the upgrade to 21.04.0 and all "queue" and "unprocessed" files must be removed.

- Improvement of the acknowledgement of events when broker is shutting down.
