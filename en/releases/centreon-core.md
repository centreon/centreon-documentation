## Centreon Engine

###Â 21.04.4

Release date: `null`

#### Bug fixes

- Badly designed mutex could cause deadlocks in centreon-clib
- [Anomaly_Detection] Units were not provided in the perfdata for lower_thresholds and upper_thresholds of Anomaly Detection services
- Fixed an issue that could cause deadlocks in the logs production
- Sending values of date_start, date_end and duration of downtimes higher than 2^31 (`Tue Jan 19 04:14:08 CET 2038`) could block broker's inserts into the database. They are now limited to `2037-12-31 23:59:59`.
- No recovery notification were sent if service goes from CRITICAL to WARNING to OK state and user deactivated WARNING notification

#### From Community

- Notifications were sent for services of a soft down host despite "Soft Service Dependencies" option being set to "yes" (fixes issue [#286](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-engine/issues/286))


### 21.04.3

`July 20, 2021`

#### Bugfixes

- Recovery notifications forgotten when engine is stopped during incident
- Engine sends service status twice when a check is forced
- Compilation issues on Raspberry Pi

### 21.04.2

`June 4, 2021`

> This version requires Centreon Broker, Centreon Clib and Centreon-Connector versions to be 21.04.1 or higher.

#### Bugfixes

- Engine cpu usage increased to 100% when `check_period` is set to `none`
- Engine/broker build migrated from Bintray to ConanCenter
- Centengine can hang when we stop it

### 21.04.1

`April 28, 2021`

#### Bugfixes

-  Bad memory access on hostgroupname/servicegroupname macros

### 21.04.0

- When used with centreon-connectors, Engine could crash when we stop it. This should be fixed now.
- Ability to submit external commands via gRPC.

> **Warning:** External commands via gRPC are proposed in beta version. The API may change in a near
future.

## Centreon Broker

### 21.04.3

`August 30, 2021`

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed a deadlock in broker with a reversed TCP output when cbd receives SIGTERM
- Fixed "MySQL server has gone away" error causing failure in BAM events computation, and data loss in BAM availability statistics

### 21.04.2

`July 20, 2021`

#### Bugfixes

- A deadlock occasionally appears when broker is stopped right after it started
- A core dump occasionally appears when Engine is stopped
- Sometimes Engine cannot reconnect to the central broker when cbd is restarted
- When many pollers attempt to connect to the central broker, the last ones may fail to connect
- Timeranges of timeperiods can't be parsed if they end with `\r` or `\n`
- Compilation issues on Raspberry Pi
- TLS query not understood by GNUTLS on Redhat 8
- Broker stream factory could not create streams with different configurations
- Error in Broker logs when exporting new BAM Business Activities
- `cb_mod` crashes when loggers section is empty/null in config file

#### Enhancements

- A new parameter has been added to Broker allowing MySQL UNIX socket selection by name

### 21.04.1

`June 4, 2021`

#### Security

- Metaservices used as KPIs did not impact BAs (Centreon BAM)
- CRITICAL impact was applied instead of UNKNOWN for BAs used as KPIs (Centreon BAM)
- Broker's restart was slowed by suboptimal queries processing downtimes and comments

### 21.04.0

> **Known issues**
> * Broker streams: the same parameter, if used in several outputs of the same broker stream, can only have one value (the last prevails).
> * BAM: the impacts of KPIs of type Meta-service are not evaluated correctly. A fix will be release very soon.
> * BAM: the impacts of KPIs of type BA in are not evaluated correctly. A fix will be release very soon.

#### New broker logs

- New logs, with new format, epoch timestamps are replaced by real dates.

> **Warning:** you may still see timestamps in your logs until you disable the
old logs system.

```log
[2021-04-16 13:49:06.781] [core] [info] Clearing old connections
[2021-04-16 13:56:10.985] [core] [info] main: configuration update requested
```

- New log config options, with a different log level for `core`, `config`, `sql`, `processing`, `perfdata`, `bbdo`, `tcp`, `tls`, `lua`, `bam`.
- Old logs are still supported, but you are encouraged to abandon them.

#### Other enhancements

- Support of UInt64 for `id` column of `index_data` table: fixes issues on platforms having a large amount of metrics.

> **Warning:** this change needs cbd service(s) to be stopped during the upgrade to 21.04.0 and all "queue" and "unprocessed" files must be removed.

- Improvement of the acknowledgement of events when broker is shutting down.
