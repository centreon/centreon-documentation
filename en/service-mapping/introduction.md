The service mapping capabilities in Centreon relies on the **Centreon Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)** extension. 


> Centreon BAM is a Centreon **extension** that requires a valid license key. To purchase one and retrieve
the necessary repositories, contact [Centreon](sales@centreon.com).

**Centreon Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)** helps ITSM and business
operation teams gain a common perspective to align IT with business.
Based on ITIL practices, it measures real-time IT operating vitals from
Centreon-monitored data to show crucial correlations to service
performance. Prioritizing and proactively managing IT operations and
service delivery for required SLA becomes easier. Centreon BAM
contributes to show that IT counts for business operations.

**Centreon BAM** uses an advanced Business Activities (BA) calculation
engine based on Key Performance Indicators.

The graphical representation of the data appears in real time on a
console that is dedicated to monitoring IT activities.

This documentation is meant to assist you in rolling out business
activities and making best use of the real-time and reporting data in
**Centreon BAM**.

Definitions :

-   **BA**: Business Activity
-   **BV**: Business View: the displayed business activity
-   **KPI**: Key Performance Indicator: the weighted indicator
    considered in the BA calculation.
