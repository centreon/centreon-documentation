> Depending on the identity provider, it is necessary to enter several scopes, this is indicated in the provider's
> configuration documentation.

> For authentication to be functional, the response to the introspection token call must return a `preferred_username`
> variable containing the user's login which will be compared with the users defined in Centreon. If it's not the case,
> you will have to configure your provider to send extra claims to an additional scope. In this case, it will be
> necessary to configure the user information endpoint and add the additional scope to the scope definition.

> If you want to automatically import user after connection, you can configure an LDAP server and enable auto import.
