## Take actions on events

### Acknowledge an event

When one or more alerts are visible, you may need to acknowledge them to tell your team that the problem
is handled, you can do that in two ways:

- By directly acknowledging on the line, a "Acknowledgement" button apper on mouse over
- By selecting multiple lines and clicking on the "Acknowledgement" button, above the table

> Only "non-ok" resources can be ackwnoledged

When a resource is acknowledged, the alert is not visible anymore in the "Unhandled problems" filter and
notifications for this resource are stopped.

### Set a planned downtime

When a maintenance is planned on one or multiple resources, you can set this planned downtime
in Centreon in two ways:

- By directly setting a planned downtime on the line when the mouse is over
- By selecting multiple lines and clicking on the "Downtime" button, above the table

When a resource is in planned downtime, the alert is not visible anymore in the "Unhandled problems" filter and
notifications for this resource are stopped.

### Refresh a status

In many situations, you need to quickly re-check one or multiple service to refresh their status.
You can set this planned downtime in Centreon in two ways:

## Filter

###  Pre-defined filters

When you open the Events view, the default filter is "Unhandled problems". This filter quickly show all problems/alerts
that are not yet handled so you can focus on choosing the most relevant alerts to take care of.
You can choose two other filters that are "Resources problems" and "All".

The following rules apply;

- Unhandled problems: resource status is Warning or Critical or Unknown or Down AND the resource is not acknowledged nor in planned downtime
- Resource problems: resource status is Warning or Critical or Unknown or Down
- All: All resources

### Search bar

It's possible to filter out the events by name of resources. You can use the power of regular expression mechanism
to finely search for resources (host or services)

By default, the search bar with look for your expression to match with

- Host name
- Host alias
- Address or FQDN
- Service description

It's possible to force search on a defined fields by using the following labels:

- h.name: only search in host.name field
- h.alias: only search in host alias field
- h.address: only search in host address field
- s.description: only search in service description field

### By advanced criteria

If pre-defined filter and the search bar are not enough, it's possible to expand the filter bar to access
the following additionnal criteria:

- Resource types (host or service)
- Statuses (Ok,Warning, Critical, Unknown, Pending, Up, Down)
- States: Is the problem already acknowledged, in a planned downtime or simply unhandled
- Host groups
- Service groups

### Save your filter

You may create some "complex" filters that set you in a specific context, using multiple criterias and even complex
regular expressions. In that case, you may want to save this filter and re-use it later.



This is possible using the **icon** next to Filter. You'll be able to:

* Save your current search as a new filter
* Save the current filter so that it's updated using your current applied criterias
* Edit filters so that you can rename, re-order or delete them

As soon as a filter is saved, it's re-usable in the Filter dropdown list, categorized under "My Filter".
