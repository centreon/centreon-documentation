Event logs allow us to:

* View the changes of status and state of the monitored objects
* See the notifications sent and their recipients

To view the event logs, go into the **Monitoring > Event logs** menu.

The upper menu can be used to select the hosts and/or the services event logs to be viewed. 
You can choose a selection of services or hosts in a list contained in servicegroup or hostgroup.

The **Message Type** and **status** field can be used to select the search filters to display the events required. 

The **Log Period** field can be used to select the time period for which we want to view the events.
The drop-down list can be used to select generic time periods. If the drop-down list is empty it is possible to choose the time period manually using the **From** and **To** fields.

The table can be used to view the results.

You can export the result through CSV or XML format using the export buttons:
