title: Configuring notifications
---

## Prerequisites

1. Check that the monitoring engine is programmed to send notifications.

    1. Go to **Configuration > Pollers > Engine configuration**.

    2. Click on the poller you want.

    3. On the **Check Options** tab, in the **Misc options** section, select **Yes** for the **Notification Option**
option. 

    4. Click **Save**.

2. Check that your Centreon can send notifications, [e.g. emails](../administration/postfix.html).

    Notification commands are executed by the poller that monitors the resource: you will need to configure the ability to send notifications on all pollers.

## Configuring notifications

### Step 1: Defining when checks must be made

1. Go to **Configuration > Hosts > Hosts** or **Configuration > Services > Services by host** and select a host or service.

2. On the **General Information** tab, fill in section **Host/Service Scheduling Options**. If no values are defined on the host or service, the host or service will inherit the values from its parent template (see [Template inheritance rules](#template-inheritance-rules)).

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Enable active checks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Set **Active checks enabled** to **Yes**         |
| Define during which [time period](../monitoring/basic-objects/timeperiods.html) active checks should be made. Outside this time period, no checks will be made, which means that no notifications will be sent.                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Check Period**                                 |
| Define how often active checks should be made when the host is in an **OK** state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Normal Check Interval**                        |
| Define what happens when the host or service enters a non-UP or non-OK (SOFT) state:<ul><li>how many times the host should be checked before it enters a HARD state (i.e. when notifications start being sent)</li><li>at what time interval these soft state checks must be made</li></ul> | <br/><ul><li>**Max Checks Attempts**</li><li>**Retry Check Interval**</li></ul> |
| When the host or service enters a HARD state, notifications start being sent.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The host is checked at the **Normal check interval**, and a notification can only be sent when a check has been made                          |

### Step 2: Configuring the notifications on the host or service

> To make the configuration of notifications faster, you can define
> the parameters on a host/service template. All hosts or services that inherit this
> template will also inherit these settings. See [Template inheritance rules](#template-inheritance-rules).

1. Go to **Configuration > Hosts > Hosts** or **Configuration > Hosts > Services** and select a host or service.

2. On the **Notifications** tab:
    - Make sure **Notifications Enabled** is set to **Yes**.
    
        If it is set to **Default**, the value applied will be that defined on the host or service template (see [Template Inheritance Rules](#template-inheritance-rules)). If no value is defined on any parent template, the default value is **No**.

    - In **Linked Contacts/Linked Contact Groups**, define which contacts will receive notifications. Notifications must be enabled for these contacts (see [Step 3](#step-3:enabling-notifications-for-the-contacts-you-have-defined)).

        > If notifications are enabled for a host and a contact is defined, notifications will also be enabled for the host's services (unless their **notification Enabled** option is set to **No**).

    - **Notification options**: Define for which statuses notifications must be sent. If no value is defined here, the value will be inherited from a parent template (see [Template inheritance rules](#template-inheritance-rules)). If no value is defined on any parent template, notifications will be sent for all statuses except for **None**.

    - **Notification Interval**: Define the number of “time units” to wait before re-notifying a contact that this host is still not up/that this service is still in a not-OK condition.
        - With the default time unit of 60s, this number will mean multiples of 1 minute.
        - Enter 0 to send just 1 notification.
        - Be aware that a notification can only be sent if a check has occurred. In order to get the expected results, the value defined in this field must be a multiple of the **Normal Check Interval** option defined on the **General Information** tab.
        - If no value is defined here, the value will be inherited from a parent template (see [Template inheritance rules](#template-inheritance-rules)).
        - If nothing is defined on the host/service or on any of its parent templates, the default value is 30 minutes. 

    - **Notification period**: Specify the [time period](../monitoring/basic-objects/timeperiods.html) during which notifications of events for this host or service can be sent out to contacts.
        - If a state change occurs during a time which is not covered by the time period, no notifications will be sent out.
        - If no value is defined on the host/service or any of its parent templates, the default value is 24x7.

    - **First notification delay**: Define the number of “time units” to wait before sending out the first problem notification when the host enters a HARD non-UP state/when the service enters a HARD non-OK state. The host or service enters a HARD state after the **Max check attempts** has been reached (defined on the **General Information** tab)
        - With the default time unit of 60s, this number will mean multiples of 1 minute.
        - If you set this value to 0, the monitoring engine will start sending out notifications immediately.
        - If nothing is defined on the host/service or on any of its parent templates, the default value is 0.

    - **Recovery notification delay**: Define the number of “time units” to wait before sending out the recovery notification when this host enters an UP state/when this service enters an OK state. 
        - With the default time unit of 60s, this number will mean multiples of 1 minute. 
        - If you set this value to 0, monitoring engine will start sending out notifications immediately. 
        - If nothing is defined on the host/service or on any of its parent templates, the default value is 0.

4. [Deploy](../monitoring/monitoring-servers/deploying-a-configuration.html) the configuration.


### Step 3: Enabling notifications for the contacts you have defined

> To make the configuration of notifications faster, you can define
> the parameters on a contact template. All contacts that inherit this
> template will also inherit these settings. See [Template inheritance rules](#template-inheritance-rules).

1. Go to **Configuration > Users > Contacts/Users** and then click on the contact you want to be notified.

2. On the **General Information** tab, in section **Notification**, check that **Enable notifications** is set to **Yes**. 
    
    If the option is set to **Default**, Centreon will use the value defined on the closest parent template. If no value is defined on any parent template, **Default** means **No** unless the contact has been configured to be notified on a host.

3. In sections **Host** and **Service**, check that the [options](#reference) are consistent with what you have defined at host/service level:
    - For instance, if you have set the **Host Notification Options** to **None** on the contact, the contact will receive no notifications for the host, even if you have enabled all types of notifications for the host. If you have enabled all types of notifications on the contact but only **Critical** notifications on a service, the contact will only receive **Critical** notifications for this service.
    - If you have defined no rule on the contact, the rules defined in the closest contact template are applied.
    - If you have defined rules on the contact, these will take precedence over rules defined on the contact template.

6. Click **Save**.

7. [Deploy](../monitoring/monitoring-servers/deploying-a-configuration.html) the configuration.

#### Reference

![image](../assets/alerts/notif_contact_config.png)

- **Host/Service Notification Options**: define in which cases the contact must receive a notification. If you select **None**, the contact will receive no notifications of any kind for hosts or services. 

- **Host/Service notification Period**: define during which [time period](../monitoring/basic-objects/timeperiods.html) the contact will receive notifications. If a state change occurs during a time which is not covered by the time period, no notifications will be sent out (even if the time period matches that defined for the host or service). Bear in mind that this time period will match the timezone defined in the user's profile (i.e. if the time period is 9 to 5 pm, the user will receive notifications between 9 and 5 pm in his timezone, which is not necessarily the same as yours).

- **Host/Service notification Commands**: define how the contact should be notified (email, pager, jabber).

## Template inheritance rules

For hosts and services, section **Scheduling Options/Service Scheduling Options** of the **General information** tab, and section **Notification Options** of the **Notifications** tab, work in the same way.

- If you fill in the options on the host or service, the values will override any value set in the templates for the host or service. 
- If no values are defined here, what will be applied are the values defined in the host's or service's template, or in their parent template, or in the parent of the parent template, etc. What takes precedence is always what is defined on the object itself or closest to it.

Example :

A service called **Memory** has the following parent templates:  Memory < OS-Linux-Memory-SNMP-custom < OS-Linux-Memory-SNMP < generic-active-service-custom < generic-active-service.

- **Memory** has nothing defined in **Service Scheduling Options**. 
- Its grandparent template, **OS-Linux-Memory-SNMP**, has values defined for **Max check attempts**, **Normal Check Interval** and **Retry Check Interval**: these will be applied to **Memory**.
- However, **OS-Linux-Memory-SNMP** has no values defined for **Check period**, **Active Checks Enabled**, **Passive Checks Enabled** and **Is volatile**. So we need to go up two levels: these values are defined on the template called **generic-active-service**.

## Contacts & Contact groups method calculation

Since Centreon version 19.10, 3 methods for determining the contacts
and groups of contacts that will be notified are available. These are defined on page 
**Administration > Parameters > Centreon UI**:

-   **Vertical Inheritance Only**: get contacts and contactgroups of
    resources and linked templates, using additive inheritance enabled
    option (Legacy method, keep for upgrade)
-   **Closest Value**: get most closed contacts and contactgroups of
    resources including templates
-   **Cumulative inheritance**: Cumulate all contacts and contactgroups
    of resources and linked templates (method used for new installation)

> The **Cumulative inheritance** option is the easiest to program.

## Troubleshooting

### Contacts are not receiving notification emails
Check the following points:
- Is the postfix service running? Use the following command:
    ```
    systemctl status postfix
    ```

- Is the following file configured correctly?

    ```
    /etc/postfix/main.cf
    ```

- Are notifications enabled for the contact? Are notifications configured correctly on the contact?

- Are notifications configured correctly on the host or service?

### Notifications are not sent in the specified interval

Check that the value you have defined in **Notification Interval** (on the 2nd tab) is a multiple of the value defined in **Normal Check Interval** (on the 1st tab).

Indeed, a notification can only be sent if a check has occurred. If you decide that checks happen every hour but notifications are to be sent out every 10 minutes, the notifications will actually be sent every hour because checks only happen every hour and not every 10 minutes. 

### Notifications have been sent outside the user's time period

Check the user's timezone: 
1. Go to **Configuration > Users > Contacts/Users** and then click on the contact you want to be notified.
2. Check the **Timezone/Location** field. The time period during which notifications will be sent to a user is the time period in his timezone.
