## Migrate your Centreon Central server

If the module **centreon-poller-display-central-1.6.x** is installed:

1. Go to the **Administration > Extensions > Modules** menu and uninstall the
**centreon-poller-display-central**.

2. Remove the associated package:

    ```shell
    yum remove centreon-poller-display-central
    ```

If your server uses the CentOS or Red Hat v7 operating system, refer to the
[upgrade procedure](../upgrade/upgrade-from-3-4.html) to upgrade your Central server.
Otherwise, refer to the [migration procedure](../migrate/migrate-from-3-4.html).

> If you use the Centreon EMS modules, you must update these repositories. Be sure
> to contact Centreon support and request new licenses.

## Migrate a Poller from Poller Display module to Remote Server

1. Go to the **Administration > Extensions > Modules** menu and uninstall the
**Centreon Poller Display** module.

2. If you installed the module using an RPM package, remove it with the
following command:

    ```shell
    yum remove centreon-poller-display
    ```

3. If your server uses the CentOS or Red Hat v7 operating system, refer to the
[upgrade procedure](../upgrade/upgrade-from-3-4.html) to upgrade your Remote Server.
Otherwise, refer to the [migration procedure](../migrate/migrate-from-3-4.html).

    > If you use Centreon EMS modules, you must update the repositories. Be sure to
    > contact your Centreon support and request new licenses.

4. Go to **Administration > Extensions > Modules** menu and install the
**centreon-license-manager** module.

5. ## Register the server

To transform the server into a Remote Server and register it to the Centreon Central server, execute the following command:

``` shell
/usr/share/centreon/bin/registerServerTopology.sh -u <API_ACCOUNT> \
-t remote -h <IP_TARGET_NODE> -n <REMOTE_SERVER_NAME>
```

Example:

``` shell
/usr/share/centreon/bin/registerServerTopology.sh -u admin -t remote -h 192.168.0.1 -n remote-1
```

> Replace **<IP_TARGET_NODE>** by the IP of the Centreon server seen by the Remote Server.

> The **<API_ACCOUNT>** must have access to configuration API. You can use default **admin** account.

> If you need to change the HTTP method or the port, you can use the following format for the **-h** option:
> HTTPS://<IP_TARGET_NODE>:PORT

Then follow instructions by
1. Entering your password:

    ``` shell
    192.168.0.1: please enter your password:
    ```

2. Select the IP address if multiple network interfaces exist:

    ```shell
    Which IP do you want to use as CURRENT NODE IP ?
    1) 192.168.0.2
    2) 192.168.0.3
    1
    ```

3. Then validate the information:

    ``` shell
    Summary of the informations that will be send:
    
    Api Connection:
    username: admin
    password: ******
    target server: 192.168.0.1
    
    Pending Registration Server:
    name: remote-1
    type: remote
    address: 192.168.0.2
    
    Do you want to register this server with those informations ? (y/n)y
    ```

4. Add additional information to enable future communication between your Remote Server and its Central,
Kindly fill in the required information to convert your platform into Remote :

    ```shell
    <CURRENT_NODE_ADDRESS> : Please enter your username:
    admin
    <CURRENT_NODE_ADDRESS> : Please enter your password:
    
    <CURRENT_NODE_ADDRESS> : Protocol [http]:
    <CURRENT_NODE_ADDRESS> : Port [80]:
    <CURRENT_NODE_ADDRESS> : centreon root folder [centreon]:
    ```

5. If you use a proxy, please define credentials:

    ```shell
    Are you using a proxy ? (y/n)
    y
    enter your proxy Host:
    myproxy.example.com
    enter your proxy Port [3128]:
    Are you using a username/password ? (y/n)
    y
    enter your username:
    my_proxy_username
    enter your password:
    
    ```

You will receive the validation of the Centreon central server:

``` shell
2020-10-16T17:19:37+02:00 [INFO]: The CURRENT NODE 'remote: 'remote-1@192.168.0.2' has been converted and registered successfully.
```
