## Update the system

Connect to your server using a terminal, and execute the command:

``` shell
yum update
```

> Accept all GPG keys if you are prompted

Then restart your server with the following command:

``` shell
reboot
```

## Register the server

To register it to the Centreon Central server or a Remote server, execute the following command:

``` shell
/opt/rh/rh-php72/root/bin/php /usr/share/centreon/bin/registerServerTopology.php -u <API_ACCOUNT> \
-t Poller -h <IP_CENTREON_CENTRAL> -n <REMOTE_SERVER_NAME>
```

Example:

``` shell
/opt/rh/rh-php72/root/bin/php /usr/share/centreon/bin/registerServerTopology.php -u admin -t Poller -h 192.168.0.1 -n poller-1
```

> Replace **<IP_CENTREON_CENTRAL>** by the IP of the Centreon server seen by the poller or by the Remote Server if you
> want to link your server to it..

> The **<API_ACCOUNT>** must have access to configuration API. you can use default **admin** account.

> If you need to change the HTTP method or the port, you can use the following format for the **-h** option:
> HTTPS://<IP_CENTREON_CENTRAL>:PORT

Then follow instructions by
1. Entering your password:

``` shell
192.168.0.1: please enter your password
```

2. Define if you use a proxy to connect to Centreon central or the Remote Server:

``` shell
Are you using a proxy ? (y/n)n
```

If you use a proxy, please define credentials:

``` shell
Are you using a proxy ? (y/n)y

proxy host: myproxy.example.com

proxy port: 3128

proxy username (press enter if no username/password are required): myuser

please enter the proxy password:
```

3. Then validate the information:

``` shell
Summary of the informations that will be send:

Api Connection:
username: admin
password: ******
target server: 192.168.0.1

Pending Registration Server:
name: poller-1
type: poller
address: 192.168.0.2
parent server address: 192.168.0.1

Do you want to register this server with those informations ? (y/n)y
```

You will receive the validation of the Centreon central or the Remote Server server:

``` shell
