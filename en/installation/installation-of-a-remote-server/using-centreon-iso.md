Installing a Remote Server is similar to installing a Centreon Central Server.

## Step 1: Startup the server

To install Centreon, start up your server from the Centreon ISO image in version el7.
Start up with **Install CentOS 7**:

## Step 2: Choose a language

Choose the language for the installation process and click on **Continue**:

## Step 3: Select the component

Click on the **Installation Type** menu:

![image](../../assets/installation/03_menu_type_install.png)

You have different options to choose from:

![image](../../assets/installation/04_form_type_install.png)

* **Central with database**: Install Centreon (web interface and database), monitoring engine and Broker.
* **Central without database**: Install Centreon (web interface only), monitoring engine and Broker.
* **Poller**: Install poller (monitoring engine and Broker only).
* **Database**: Install database server (if you have already installed a **Central server without a database** option).

After selecting your installation type, click **Done**.

## Step 4: System configuration

### Configure disk Partitioning

Click on the **Installation Destination** menu:

![image](../../assets/installation/05_menu_filesystem.png)

Select the hard disk drive and the **I will configure partitioning** option. Then click on **Done**:

![image](../../assets/installation/06_select_disk.png)

Using the **+** button, create your own partitioning file system following the instructions in
[prerequisites chapter](../prerequisites.html). Then click on **Done**:

![image](../../assets/installation/07_partitioning_filesystem.png)

> It is recommended to use LVM as the default partitioning scheme.

A confirmation window appears. Click on **Accept Changes** to validate the partitioning:

### Configure the timezone

Click on the **Date & Time** menu:

![image](../../assets/installation/11_menu_timezone.png)

Select the time zone and then click the gear button to configure the NTP server:

![image](../../assets/installation/12_select_timzeone.png)

Type in the name of the NTP server you wish to use and click the plus button. Or, select one from the list of
predefined NTP servers then click **OK** and then **Done**:

![image](../../assets/installation/13_enable_ntp.png)

> It is okay that you can't enable the “network time” option in this screen. It will become enabled automatically when
> you configure the network and hostname.

### Configure the network

Click on the **Network & Hostname** menu:

![image](../../assets/installation/09_menu_network.png)

Enable all network interfaces by clicking the button in the top right from **off** to **on**. Then click on **Done**:

![image](../../assets/installation/10_network_hostname.png)

## Begin the installation

Once configuration is complete, click on **Begin Installation**:

![image](../../assets/installation/14_begin_install.png)

Click on **Root Password**:

![image](../../assets/installation/15_menu_root_password.png)

Define and confirm the **root** user password. Click on **Done**:

![image](../../assets/installation/16_define_root_password.png)

Wait for the installation process to finish. You can also use this time to add additional users to the system if you
desire.

![image](../../assets/installation/17_wait_install.png)

When the installation is complete, click on **Reboot**:

![image](../../assets/installation/18_reboot_server.png)

## Update the system

Connect to your server using a terminal, and execute the command:

``` shell
yum update
```

> Accept all GPG keys if you are prompted

Then restart your server with the following command:

``` shell
reboot
```

### Services startup during system bootup

To make services start automatically during system bootup, run these commands
on the remote server:

```shell
systemctl enable rh-php72-php-fpm httpd24-httpd mariadb centreon cbd centengine gorgoned snmptrapd centreontrapd snmpd
```

## Web installation

Conclude installation by performing [web installation steps](../web-and-post-installation.html#Web-installation).

> In the step **Initialization of the monitoring**, only the actions from 6 to 8
> must be done.

## Enable the Remote Server option

To transform the server into a Remote Server, connect to the server and
execute following command:

``` shell
/usr/share/centreon/bin/centreon -u admin -p centreon -a enableRemote -o CentreonRemoteServer \
-v '<IP_CENTREON_CENTRAL>;<don't check SSL CA on Central>;<HTTP method>;<TCP port>;<don't check SSL CA on Remote>;<no proxy to call Central>'
```

  - Replace **\<IP_CENTREON_CENTRAL\>** by the IP of the Centreon server as seen
    by the poller. You can define multiple IP address using a comma as separator.

    > To use HTTPS, replace **\<IP_CENTREON_CENTRAL\>** by
    > **https://\<IP_CENTREON_CENTRAL\>**.
    >
    > To use non default port, replace **\<IP_CENTREON_CENTRAL\>** by
    > **\<IP_CENTREON_CENTRAL\>:\<PORT\>**

  - For the **\<don't check SSL CA on Central\>** option, you should put **1** if
    you intend not to check the SSL CA on the Centreon Central Server whenever
    HTTPS is enabled, or put **0**.

  - The **\<HTTP method\>** option defines how the Centreon Central server can
    contact the Remote server: HTTP or HTTPS.

  - The **\<TCP port\>** option defines on which TCP port the Centreon Central
    server can contact the Remote server.

  - For the **\<don't check SSL CA on Remote\>** option, you should put **1** if
    you intend not to check the SSL CA on the Remote server whenever HTTPS is
    enabled, or put **0**.

  - For the **\<no proxy to call Central\>** option, you should put **1** if you
    intend not to use an HTTP(S) proxy to contact the Centreon Central server.


For instance :
``` shell
/usr/share/centreon/bin/centreon -u admin -p centreon -a enableRemote -o CentreonRemoteServer -v '10.1.2.3;1;HTTP;80;1;1'
```

This command will enable **Remote Server** mode:

  - by limiting menu access,
  - by limiting possible actions,
  - by allowing the Central to connect to it,
  - by pre-registering the server to the Central.

```text
Starting Centreon Remote enable process:
Limiting Menu Access...               Success
Limiting Actions...                   Done
Authorizing Master...                 Done
Set 'remote' instance type...         Done
Notifying Master...
Trying host '10.1.2.3'... Success
Centreon Remote enabling finished.
```

Finally, add rights to **centreon** database user to use **LOAD DATA INFILE**
command:

```sql
GRANT FILE on *.* to 'centreon'@'localhost';
```

## Add the Remote Server to configuration

Go to the
[Add a Remote Server to configuration](../../monitoring/monitoring-servers/add-a-remote-server-to-configuration.html).
