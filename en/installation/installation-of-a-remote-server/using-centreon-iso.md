title: Using Centreon ISO
---

Installing a Remote Server is similar to installing a Centreon Central Server.

> If you want to install Centreon on CentOS / Oracle Linux / RHEL distribution
> in version 8, you must [use RPM packages](./using-packages.html)

## Step 1: Startup the server

To install Centreon, start up your server from the Centreon ISO image in version el7.
Start up with **Install CentOS 7**:

## Step 2: Choose a language

Choose the language for the installation process and click on **Continue**:

![image](../../assets/installation/02_select_install_lang.png)

## Step 3: Select the component

Click on the **Installation Type** menu:

![image](../../assets/installation/03_menu_type_install.png)

You have different options to choose from:

![image](../../assets/installation/04_form_type_install.png)

* **Central with database**: Install Centreon (web interface and database), monitoring engine and Broker.
* **Central without database**: Install Centreon (web interface only), monitoring engine and Broker.
* **Poller**: Install poller (monitoring engine and Broker only).
* **Database**: Install database server (if you have already installed a **Central server without a database** option).

After selecting your installation type, click **Done**.

## Step 4: System configuration

### Configure disk Partitioning

Click on the **Installation Destination** menu:

![image](../../assets/installation/05_menu_filesystem.png)

Select the hard disk drive and the **I will configure partitioning** option. Then click on **Done**:

![image](../../assets/installation/06_select_disk.png)

Using the **+** button, create your own partitioning file system following the instructions in
[prerequisites chapter](../prerequisites.html). Then click on **Done**:

![image](../../assets/installation/07_partitioning_filesystem.png)

> It is recommended to use LVM as the default partitioning scheme.

A confirmation window appears. Click on **Accept Changes** to validate the partitioning:

### Configure the timezone

Click on the **Date & Time** menu:

![image](../../assets/installation/11_menu_timezone.png)

Select the time zone and then click the gear button to configure the NTP server:

![image](../../assets/installation/12_select_timzeone.png)

Type in the name of the NTP server you wish to use and click the plus button. Or, select one from the list of
predefined NTP servers then click **OK** and then **Done**:

![image](../../assets/installation/13_enable_ntp.png)

> It is okay that you can't enable the “network time” option in this screen. It will become enabled automatically when
> you configure the network and hostname.

### Configure the network

Click on the **Network & Hostname** menu:

![image](../../assets/installation/09_menu_network.png)

Enable all network interfaces by clicking the button in the top right from **off** to **on**. Then click on **Done**:

![image](../../assets/installation/10_network_hostname.png)

## Begin the installation

Once configuration is complete, click on **Begin Installation**:

![image](../../assets/installation/14_begin_install.png)

Click on **Root Password**:

![image](../../assets/installation/15_menu_root_password.png)

Define and confirm the **root** user password. Click on **Done**:

![image](../../assets/installation/16_define_root_password.png)

Wait for the installation process to finish. You can also use this time to add additional users to the system if you
desire.

![image](../../assets/installation/17_wait_install.png)

When the installation is complete, click on **Reboot**:

![image](../../assets/installation/18_reboot_server.png)

## Update the system

Connect to your server using a terminal, and execute the command:

``` shell
yum update
```

> Accept all GPG keys if you are prompted

Then restart your server with the following command:

``` shell
reboot
```

### Services startup during system bootup

To make services start automatically during system bootup, run these commands
on the central server:

```shell
systemctl enable rh-php73-php-fpm httpd24-httpd mariadb centreon cbd centengine gorgoned snmptrapd centreontrapd snmpd
```

## Web installation

Conclude installation by performing [web installation steps](../web-and-post-installation.html#Web-installation).

> During web installation, it is not necessary to install Autodiscovery module.

> In the step **Initialization of the monitoring**, only the actions from 6 to 8
> must be done.

## Register the server

To transform the server into a Remote Server and register it to the Centreon Central server, execute the following command:

``` shell
/usr/share/centreon/bin/registerServerTopology.sh -u <API_ACCOUNT> \
-t remote -h <IP_TARGET_NODE> -n <POLLER_NAME>
```

Example:

``` shell
/usr/share/centreon/bin/registerServerTopology.sh -u admin -t remote -h 192.168.0.1 -n remote-1
```

> Replace **<IP_TARGET_NODE>** by the IP of the Centreon server seen by the Remote Server.

> The **<API_ACCOUNT>** must have access to configuration API. You can use default **admin** account.

> If you need to change the HTTP method or the port, you can use the following format for the **-h** option:
> HTTPS://<IP_TARGET_NODE>:PORT

Then follow instructions by
1. Entering your password:

    ``` shell
    192.168.0.1: please enter your password:
    ```

2. Select the IP address if multiple network interfaces exist:

    ```shell
    Which IP do you want to use as CURRENT NODE IP ?
    1) 192.168.0.2
    2) 192.168.0.3
    1
    ```

3. Then validate the information:

    ``` shell
    Summary of the informations that will be send:
    
    Api Connection:
    username: admin
    password: ******
    target server: 192.168.0.1
    
    Pending Registration Server:
    name: remote-1
    type: remote
    address: 192.168.0.2
    
    Do you want to register this server with those informations ? (y/n)y
    ```

4. Add additional information to enable future communication between your Remote Server and its Central,
kindly fill in the required information to convert your platform into Remote :

    ```shell
    <CURRENT_NODE_ADDRESS> : Please enter your username:
    admin
    <CURRENT_NODE_ADDRESS> : Please enter your password:
    
    <CURRENT_NODE_ADDRESS> : Protocol [http]:
    <CURRENT_NODE_ADDRESS> : Port [80]:
    <CURRENT_NODE_ADDRESS> : centreon root folder [centreon]:
    ```

5. If you use a proxy, please define credentials:

    ```shell
    Are you using a proxy ? (y/n)
    y
    enter your proxy Host:
    myproxy.example.com
    enter your proxy Port [3128]:
    Are you using a username/password ? (y/n)
    y
    enter your username:
    my_proxy_username
    enter your password:
    
    ```

You will receive the validation of the Centreon central server:

``` shell
2020-10-16T17:19:37+02:00 [INFO]: The CURRENT NODE 'remote: 'remote-1@192.168.0.2' has been converted and registered successfully.
```

### Main errors messages

## Extend local DBMS rights

Finally, add rights to **centreon** database user to use **LOAD DATA INFILE**
command:

```sql
GRANT FILE on *.* to 'centreon'@'localhost';
```

## Add the Remote Server to configuration

Go to the
[Add a Remote Server to configuration](../../monitoring/monitoring-servers/add-a-remote-server-to-configuration.html).

## Secure your platform

Don't forget to secure your Centreon platform following our
[recommendations](../../administration/secure-platform.html)
