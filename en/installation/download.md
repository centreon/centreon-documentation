Open Source software supplied by Centreon is generally available in 4 formats:

* [Virtual machines, based on CentOS v7 distribution](https://download.centreon.com), with OVA (VMware) and OVF (VirtualBox and others) formats,
* [Archives containing the sources](https://download.centreon.com).

RPM packages and ISO linux are the best format to obtain our software. They are packaged by Centreon experts and relieve
you of any concern over the installation process.

> Centreon recommends using the [Centreon ISO](installation-of-a-central-server/using-centreon-iso.html) version.

If your platform does not support RPM packages, you should use archives containing the sources of stable versions of
our software and install them manually. Manual compilation of some packages can be complex.
