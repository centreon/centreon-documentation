title: Upgrade from Centreon 20.10
---

This chapter describes how to upgrade your Centreon platform from version 20.10
to version 21.04.

> If you want to migrate your Centreon server to CentOS / Oracle Linux / RHEL 8
> you need to follow the [migration procedure](../migrate/migrate-from-20-x)

> To perform this procedure, your MariaDB version must be >= 10.3.22.
> If not, please follow before the [MariaDB update chapter](./upgrade-from-19-10.html#upgrade-mariadb-server)

## Perform a backup

Be sure that you have fully backed up your environment for the following
servers:

- Central server
- Database server

## Upgrade the Centreon Central server

> Since 21.04, Centreon uses **MariaDB 10.5**.
>
> This upgrade process will only upgrade Centreon components first.
>
> MariaDB will be upgraded afterwards.

### Update the Centreon repository

Run the following commands:

```shell
yum install -y http://yum.centreon.com/standard/21.04/el7/stable/noarch/RPMS/centreon-release-21.04-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm
```

### Upgrade the Centreon solution

Clean yum cache:

```shell
yum clean all --enablerepo=*
```

Then upgrade all the components with the following command:

```shell
yum update centreon\*
```

> Accept new GPG keys from the repositories as needed.

### Finalizing the upgrade

Before starting the web upgrade process, reload the Apache server with the
following command:

```shell
systemctl reload httpd24-httpd
```

Then log on to the Centreon web interface to continue the upgrade process:

If the Centreon BAM module is installed, refer to the
[upgrade procedure](../service-mapping/upgrade.html).

### Post-upgrade actions

#### Upgrade extensions

From `Administration > Extensions > Manager`, upgrade all extensions, starting
with the following:

  - License Manager,
  - Plugin Packs Manager,
  - Auto Discovery.

Then you can upgrade all other commercial extensions.

### Upgrade MariaDB server

The MariaDB components can now be upgraded.

Be aware that MariaDB strongly recommends to upgrade the server through each
major release. Please refer to the [official MariaDB
documentation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading/) for further information.

You then need to upgrade from 10.3 to 10.4 and from 10.4 to 10.5.

That is why Centreon provides both 10.4 and 10.5 versions on its stable
repositories.
