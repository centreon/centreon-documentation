title: Upgrade from Centreon 20.04
---

This chapter describes how to upgrade your Centreon platform from version 20.04
to version 20.10.

## Perform a backup

Be sure that you have fully backed up your environment for the following
servers:

- Central server
- Database server

## Update the RPM signing key

For security reasons, the keys used to sign Centreon RPMs are rotated regularly. The last change occurred on October 14, 2021. When upgrading from an older version, you need to go through the [key rotation procedure](../security/key-rotation.html#existing-installation), to remove the old key and install the new one.

## Upgrade the Centreon Central server

### Update the Centreon repository

Run the following commands:

```shell
yum install -y https://yum.centreon.com/standard/20.10/el7/stable/noarch/RPMS/centreon-release-20.10-3.el7.centos.noarch.rpm
```

> If you are using a CentOS environment, you must install the *Software
> Collections* repositories with the following command:
>
> ```shell
> yum install -y centos-release-scl-rh
> ```

### Upgrade the Centreon solution

Clean yum cache:

```shell
yum clean all --enablerepo=*
```

Then upgrade all the components with the following command:

```shell
yum update centreon\*
```

> Accept new GPG keys from the repositories as needed.

### Finalizing the upgrade

Before starting the web upgrade process, reload the Apache server with the
following command:

```shell
systemctl reload httpd24-httpd
```

Then log on to the Centreon web interface to continue the upgrade process:
