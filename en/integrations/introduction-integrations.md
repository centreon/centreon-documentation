insights from your monitoring data while seamlessly integrating with your existing processes thanks 
to advanced filtering and formatting capabilities.

extension introduces additional UI actions and backend boiler-plates to create 
cases within your favorite ticketing system.

the possibility of grabbing data from other monitoring tools and making Centreon 
the single pane of glass for all your alerts.

This documention is organized to guide you to the right integration depending upon the
