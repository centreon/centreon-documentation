title: Introduction to third-party integrations
---

Centreon provides numerous ways to cooperate with third-party tools to guarantee 
a perfect integration within your IT ecosystem.

Integrations rely on various modules and features to make Centreon compliant with 
your data, alert, events, or metrics management processes: 

- [Centreon Stream Connector](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-stream-connector-scripts), 
get the capability to send event and metrics data to a third-party tool and sharing, 
presenting, or extending the usage on top of your monitoring data.

- [Centreon Open Ticket](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-open-tickets) 
extension introduces additional UI actions and backend boiler-plates to create 
cases within your favorite ticketing system. 

- [Centreon Plugin Packs](../integrations/plugin-packs/introduction.html), offers 
the possibility of grabbing data from other monitoring tools and making Centreon 
the single pane of glass for all your alerts.

We build this documentation on top of the features and value proposition third-party 
solutions Centreon can connect to are offering. Here is a brief description of the 
purpose of each of these sections: 

- *Data Analytics*: Send your data to solutions specialized in storing, indexing, 
or managing vast and heterogeneous data sources. It also highlights solutions to 
generate alerts from log management solutions.
- *Digital Experience Monitoring*: Get measurements from tools dedicated to tracking 
the web and application performances to correlate it within Centreon by combining 
it with other monitoring probes.
- *Event Management*: Leverage the power of Stream Connector to send your logs and 
alerts your incident management solution to externalize incident management, including 
escalations or automation. 
- *Notifications*: Use the Centreon Engine scheduler notification system to send 
alerts efficiently to the right person using multiple communication mediums (SMS, Instant Messaging, SNMP Traps, ...).
