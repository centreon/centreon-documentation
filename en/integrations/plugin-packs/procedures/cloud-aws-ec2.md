## Overview

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

## Monitored metrics 

You can get more details on AWS/EC2 Cloudwatch metrics in the official AWS documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/index.html. 

In addition to modes and metrics described here, it is also possible to monitor the following indicators:

 * Instance-Types: Number of instances of each AWS Family and associated types.
 * Instance-Status: Global health check and count of EC2 instances.

### Plugin dependencies

To interact with Amazon APIs, you can use either use the *awscli* binary provided by Amazon or *paws*, a Perl AWS SDK (recommended). You must install it on every poller expected to monitor AWS resources. 

> **Warning** For now, it is not possible to use *paws* if you are using a proxy to reach AWS Cloudwatch APIs. 

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

## FAQ

### How can I test it through the CLI and what is the meaning of the command_line parameters ?

Once the plugin installed, log into your Centreon Poller using the *centreon-engine* user account and test by running the following 
command (Some of the parameters such as ```name``` have to be adjusted):

```bash
/usr/lib/centreon/plugins//centreon_aws_ec2_api.pl
	--plugin=cloud::aws::ec2::plugin
	--mode=cpu
	--custommode='awscli'
	--aws-secret-key='***'
	--aws-access-key='AKIA5EDPTASPNBK5EMTM'
	--region='eu-west-1'
	--type='asg'
	--name='centreon-front'
	--filter-metric='Utilization'
	--statistic='average'
	--timeframe='600'
	--period='60'
	--warning-cpu-utilization='80'
	--critical-cpu-utilization='90'
```

Expected command output is shown below: 

```bash 	
OK: Asg 'centreon-front' Statistic 'Average' Metrics CPU Utilization: 35.81 | 'centreon-front~average#ec2.cpu.utilization.percentage'=35.81;80;90;;
```

The command above monitors the CPU Utilization (```--mode=cpu```) of the *centreon-front* (```--name='centreon-front'```) 
Autoscaling Group  (```--type='asg'```). This ASG is deployed  within the AWS eu-west-1 region (```--region='eu-west-1'```). 
The collected metrics will be parsed as average statistics (```--statistic='average'```) over a timeframe of 600 secondes (```--timeframe='600'```) 
with a sample of 1 point per minute (```--period='60'```).

This command would trigger a WARNING alert if the CPU Utilization is higher than 80% and a CRITICAL alert if higher than 90%.

All the options that can be used with this Plugin can be displayed by adding the  ```--help``` parameter to the command:

```
/usr/lib/centreon/plugins/centreon_aws_ec2_api.pl --plugin=cloud::aws::ec2::plugin --mode=cpu --help
```

### Why do I get the following result ```UNKNOWN: No metrics. Check your options or use --zeroed option to set 0 on undefined values``` ?

This command result means that Amazon Cloudwatch does not have any value for the requested period.

This result can be overriden by adding the ```--zeroed``` option in the command. This will force a value of 0 when no metric 
has been collected and will prevent the UNKNOWN error message. 

### Why do I get the following result ```UNKNOWN: Command error:  - An error occurred (AuthFailure) [...]``` ? 

This command result means that the credentials provided don't have enough privileges to perform the underlying AWS Operation.

### Why do I get the following result ```UNKNOWN: Command error:  - An error occurred (InvalidParameterValue) [...]```

Most of the time, this command result highlights typo/mispelling in the Amazon Dimension name (```--name```).
