## Opsgenie + Centreon Integration Benefits

* Manage your notifications when an alert is detected by Centreon.
* Deduplicate your alerts from Centreon
* Distinguish alerts from incidents using Centreon BAM and Opsgenie
* Create reporting based on your notifications from Centreon

## How it Works

* Every time a service, a host or a BA state is checked, the event passes through Centreon Broker, which loads the Stream Connector to send state changes.
* State changes can occur in case of an anomaly detection.
* An alias is generated for each alert to make use of Opsgenie deduplication:

## Requirements

* Opsgenie integration requires two different API key. The first one is an integration API key coming from the **Rest API HTTPS over JSON** integration. This integration must have the **Create and Update Access**. The second access is an API key coming from the **APP Settings**. This key must have the **Create and Update** access right. 
* It is also necessary to use a Centreon account with either **admin privileges** or **Export configuration** and **Broker configuration** menu access in the WUI, as well as a **`root` access in command-line interface**.

## Support

If you need help with this integration, depending on how you are using Centreon, you can:

* **Commercial Edition customers**: please contact the [Centreon Support team](mailto:support@centreon.com).
* **Open Source Edition users** or **Centreon IT-100 users** (free versions): please reach our [Community Slack](https://centreon.github.io) where our users and staff will try to help you.

## Integration Walkthrough

### In Opsgenie

#### Opsgenie integration: alerts

1. From the **Settings** menu, select **Integration list**.
2. In the integration list, add an **API** integration (Rest API HTTPS over JSON).
3. Head over the **Configured integrations** menu and edit your **API** integration to enable it if it is not. You also must to give it a **Create and Update Access**. Save your configuration and the **API Key** that is mandatory to send alerts from Centreon to Opsgenie. This **API key** is referred as **integration_api_token** in the Centreon configuration.

#### Opsgenie integration: incidents

1. Before starting, this integration will only work if you are using the Centreon BAM module.
2. From the **Settings** menu, select **API key management** in the subcategory **APP SETTINGS**.
3. In the **API key management** menu, add a new API key with **Create and Update** access
4. Save your configuration and your **Api key** that is mandatory to send incidents from Centreon to Opsgenie. This **API key** is referred as **app_api_token** in the Centreon configuration.

### In Centreon

#### Installation 

Login as `root` on the Centreon central server using your favorite SSH client.

In case your Centreon central server must use a proxy server to reach the Internet, you will have to export the `https_proxy` environment variable and configure `yum` to be able to install everything.

```bash
export https_proxy=http://my.proxy.server:3128
echo "proxy=http://my.proxy.server:3128" >> /etc/yum.conf
```

Now that your Centreon central server is able to reach the Internet, you can run:

```bash
yum install -y lua-curl epel-release
```

These packages are necessary for the script to run. Now let's download the script:

```bash
wget -O /usr/share/centreon-broker/lua/opsgenie.lua https://raw.githubusercontent.com/centreon/centreon-stream-connector-scripts/master/opsgenie/opsgenie.lua
chmod 644 /usr/share/centreon-broker/lua/opsgenie.lua
```

The Opsgenie Stream Connnector is now installed on your Centreon central server!

#### Broker configuration

1. Login to the Centreon WUI using an administrator account.
2. Navigate to the **Configuration** > **Pollers** menu and select **Broker configuration**.
3. Click on the **central-broker-master** broker configuration object and navigate to the **Output** tab.
4. Add a new **Generic - Stream connector** output.
5. Name it as you want (eg. **Opsgenie**) and set the right path for the LUA script: `/usr/share/centreon-broker/lua/opsgenie.lua`.
6. Add at least one string parameter. That parameter is a key that must be configured. The parameter name *must be* `app_api_token` (for the alerts) or `integration_api_token` (for the incidents, requires the Centreon BAM module). If you want to use both aspects then you need to add both parameters in your configuration

| Name                      | Type   | Value                   |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| `app_api_token`           | String | `<paste your key here>` |
| `integration_api_token`   | String | `<paste your key here>` |

7. Save your configuration, then navigate to the **Configuration** > **Pollers** menu and select **Pollers**.
8. Select the **Central** poller and click on **Export configuration**.
9. Keep **Generate Configuration Files** and **Run monitoring engine debug (-v)** checked and select **Move Export Files** and then click on the **Export** button.
10. Restart the `cbd` service:

```bash
systemctl restart cbd
```

Now your central server has loaded the Opsgenie Stream Connector and has started to send data!

To make sure that everything goes fine, you should have a look at `central-broker-master.log` and `connector-opsgenie.log`, both located in `/var/log/centreon-broker`.

**Remarks**

* A value of 2 for `log_level` is fine for initial troubleshooting, but can generate a huge amount of logs if you monitor a lot of hosts. In order to get less log messages, you should keep it a 1.

## How to Uninstall

1. Login to the Centreon WUI using an administrator account.
2. Navigate to the **Configuration** > **Pollers** menu and select **Broker configuration**.
3. Click on the **central-broker-master** broker configuration object and navigate to the **Output** tab.
4. Delete the **Generic - Stream connector** output by clicking on the red circled cross at the end of the line.
5. Save your configuration, then navigate to the **Configuration** > **Pollers** menu and select **Pollers**.
6. Select the **Central** poller and click on **Export configuration**.
7. Keep **Generate Configuration Files** and **Run monitoring engine debug (-v)** checked and select **Move Export Files** and then click on the **Export** button.
8. Restart the `cbd` service:

```bash
systemctl restart cbd
```

The Stream Connector is not loaded anymore!

9. Optionally, you can even delete the script file:

```bash
rm -f /usr/share/centreon-broker/lua/opsgenie.lua
```

## Macros

Macros are a tool to create dynamic messages depending on the event you want to send. They must be enclosed by {} (eg: {hostname}). If a macro is a time type macro then you will be able to use **\_date suffix** to convert it to a human readable format. You can Change this format using the string parameter `date_format` (eg: {last_update} is a timestamp macro. You can use {last_update_date} to have it converted)
