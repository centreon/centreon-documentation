title: Upgrade the extension
---

This chapter describes how to upgrade your Centreon MAP extension. This
is done by upgrading the three main components:

- Centreon MAP server
- Centreon MAP web interface & its widget
- Desktop client (automatically updated).

Before upgrading Centreon MAP server, we highly recommend performing a
MariaDB dump (backup) of your `centreon_studio` database. This will
allow you easily to roll back to the previous state if necessary.

Be sure to read the release notes for an explanation of features, fixes
& custom procedures.

**When you're upgrading to a new major or minor version (i.e:A.B.x with
A or B that changes) you need to contact our Support service to retrieve
the new repository**

## Centreon MAP server

> If you are still running version **4.0.X**, you **must first install
> and run the server in version 4.1.X before upgrading to the latest
> version**.

Run the following commands to upgrade your Centreon MAP server:

1. Stop and disable legacy tomcat service coming from precedent version:

    ```shell
    systemctl stop tomcat
    systemctl disable tomcat
    ```

2. Update Centreon & Centreon MAP repositories:
