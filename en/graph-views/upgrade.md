title: Upgrade the extension
---

This chapter describes how to upgrade your Centreon MAP extension. This is done
by upgrading the three main components:

  - Centreon MAP server
  - Centreon MAP web interface & its widget
  - Desktop client (automatically updated).

Before upgrading Centreon MAP server, we highly recommand performing a MariaDB
dump (backup) of your `centreon_studio` database. This will allow you easily to
roll back to the previous state if necessary.

Be sure to read the release notes for an explanation of features, fixes & custom
procedures.

**If you're updating to a new major or minor version (i.e:A.B.x with A or B that
changes) you need to contact our Support service to retrieve the new
repository**

## Centreon MAP Server

> If you are still running version **4.0.X**, you **must first install and run
> the server in version 4.1.X before upgrading to the latest version**.

Run the following commands to upgrade your Centreon MAP server:

- Stop and disable legacy tomcat service coming from precedent version
``` shell
# systemctl stop tomcat
# systemctl disable tomcat
```
- Update Centreon repo and update Centreon MAP server
``` shell
# yum install -y http://yum.centreon.com/standard/20.04/el7/stable/noarch/RPMS/centreon-release-20.04-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm
# yum update centreon-map-server
```
- Enable and start centreon-map service
``` shell
# systemctl enable centreon-map
# systemctl start centreon-map
```
> If you want totally clean up legacy Tomcat service, you can just remove Tomcat and move old log file to new log folder:
``` shell
# yum remove tomcat
# cp /var/log/centreon-studio/* /var/log/centreon-map/ 
# rm -rf /var/log/centreon-studio
```

## Centreon MAP Web interface

``` shell
yum update centreon-map-web-client
```

(module & widget parts):
