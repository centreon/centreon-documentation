## Administrate users rights

There is two kinds of administrators, Centreon admins and Map admins.

On fresh install, only Centreon admins exist.

Centreon admins may grant Map admins privileges through ACL groups defined in
Centreon.

Any user contained in that group then become a Map administrator.

### Manage Map administrators

To grant Map administrator privileges on an ACL group:

Go to `Preferences > Preferences` then select *Admin* tab.

### Give access on views to other users and manage their privileges

By default non-admin users have no access on views, and have no
privileges.

Administrators may grant these accesses and privileges to specifics set
of users through ACL groups.

ACL groups may be allowed to visualize, create, modify and delete one or
more views independently.

Go into `Preferences > Preferences` and then select *Views > ACLs* tab.

![image](../assets/graph-views/acl_views_preference_page.png)

Select, from the list, the ACL group you want to configure. Then, for
each view, define the specific rights to attribute.

**GeoViews**

Two simple rules apply on this kind of view:

- Any user accessing the `Monitoring > Map` page will be able to see all the
  created geographic views
- Users that have "Creation" privilege (through ACL group on Centreon Map
  desktop client) have all privileges on geographic views

## Load disabled resources (or not)

You can decide whether to load disabled resources into Centreon Map
desktop client. If you do (which is the default configuration), all
disabled resources will appear in the resource list. You will also be
able to use them into your views.

They will have no status and appear as shown in the following screenshot:

![image](../assets/graph-views/disabled-resources.png)

You may change this configuration by opening the file
`/etc/centreon-studio/studio-config.properties` and adding the following
line:

```text
resource.load.enabled.only=true
```

Then restart the Centreon MAP server:

```shell
systemctl restart centreon-map
```

## Define views & status computation parameters

Centreon Map server gives you the possibility to customize how this
inherited status is computed & rendered in views. You may use the
following parameters to adapt the behavior of inherited status
computation to your use case.

| Parameter                           | Possible value | Default value | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| drilldown.useHardState              | true or false  | false         | Only use hard state value for inherited status propagation                                   |
| drilldown.ignoreElementInDowntime   | true or false  | false         | Do not propagate status for resources in downtime                                            |
| drilldown.ignoreElementAcknowledged | true or false  | false         | Do not propagate status for acknowledged resources                                           |
| drilldown.ignoreSeveritySuperior    | integer        | 0             | Do not propagate status for resources having severity superior to this value                 |
| gate.useResourcesAccess             | true or false  | true          | Should Centreon Map consider resources ACL when calculating inherited status of view content |

The following parameters can be configured in
`/etc/centreon-studio/studio-config.properties`.

If you add, remove or update a parameter, make sure to restart centreon-map.

**What's an inherited status ?**

An inherited status is a Centreon Map custom status associated to some
objects that is based on the worst status of its children, here are the
rules:

- A host has two statuses: its own status (up/down/pending) and an inherited
  status that is based on the worst state of its services.
- A hostgroup only has an inherited status corresponding to the worst status
  of its children (hosts, services)
- A servicegroup has only an inherited status: the worst status of its
 children (services)
- A container has only an inherited status: the worst status of its children
  (hosts, services, meta-services, hotsgroups, servicegroups, BA, widgets)

**Inherited status customization**

Centreon Map server gives you the possibility to customize how this
inherited status is computed & rendered in views. You may use the
following parameters to adapt the behavior of inherited status
computation to your use case:

Specificity of **gate.useResourcesAccess**: Settings this parameter to
"false" may highly improve Centreon Map performances, here is why:

- gate.useResourcesAccess = false: all users see the same status & same
  resources in views, no matter the ACL ressources they have, they're ignored.
  In that case, be careful who you're giving access to views
- gate.useResourcesAccess = true: users see different status & views regarding
  resources ACLs (decrease performance because you need to have one instance
  of each view for each users)

To configure these parameters you need to edit the following Centreon
MAP server configuration file (modify or add missing parameters), then
restart centreon-map:

```shell
vim /etc/centreon-studio/studio-config.properties
systemctl restart centreon-map
```

## Change link colors

> This property will only be applied to the user modifying it on the
> desktop client.

You can change the start and end color of a link based on a metric.
These colors represent a scale from 0% to 100% for the metric(s)
associated with the link.

## Understand how resources synchronization works

Each time you make changes to Centreon's configuration and push the
configuration to any poller, the configuration is scanned and updated on
Centreon MAP.

However, if you make any changes (add/delete/update) to Centreon's
resources and want these changes to be immediately synchronized on your
Centreon MAP without pushing the configuration, you can force a resource
synchronization from Centreon MAP's desktop client through the following
menu `Action > Synchronize resources`.

This operation may take a few seconds. A pop-up will tell you when the
synchronization is complete.

## Highlight problems

> This property will only be applied to the user modifying it on the
> desktop client.

You can change the size of elements according to their status as a way
of highlighting a problem. This only works when elements are expressed
in the *geometric style*.

![image](../assets/graph-views/guide_object_ratio_example.png)

To use this feature, edit the Status size properties in the desktop
Preferences. Go to `Status > Status size` to configure it globally or to
`Views > Status > Status size` to configure it at the view level.

## Geo view configuration

### Configure tiles provider

You can choose the tile service provider or even add your own provider
in `Administration > Extension > Map | Options`. By default, Centreon Map
geoviews comes Open Street Map & Mapbox.

Please refer to [this
link](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/) to understand Open
Street Map Tile usage policy.

To change the tile provider, select one in the list and click save.

![image](../assets/graph-views/geo_options.png)

If you want to use your own Tile service provider, if for example you
have an internal Open Street Map server, go to the
`Administration > Extension > Map | Options` and choose the "Custom" style.

Define the parameters needed and then save.

![image](../assets/graph-views/geo_custom_provider.png)

### Configure data layers

You can add any external data layer to Centreon GeoView by going to
`Administration > Extension > Map`. The layer mechanism is the same that the
tiles provider: we're compatible with tiles map (TMS).

Most of the time, the data layer configuration will consist in:

- Defining the URL,
- Setting your token,
- Adding any extra parameters in a JSON format.

## Create and link a Mapbox account

If you want to be able to have a geographic background on standard views
and/or use it as a tile service provider in GeoView, you need to have a
Mapbox account & link it to your Centreon Map.

**Create an account**

Mapbox is a service that generates attractive and customizable maps. You
can use Mapbox with Centreon MAP for free by:

1. Creating an account [on Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
2. [Retrieving a private
   token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/#creating-and-managing-access-tokens)
   from your Mapbox account and add it to the configuration of the Centreon MAP
   Server (or during the installation).

During the token creation, you're asked to select properties, select:

- Public scopes: *styles:read* and *styles:tiles*
- Secret scopes: *styles:list*

Your account allows free limited use of the service up to 50k tiles/month.

*A tile is an image used to compose the geographic view.*

If you need more tiles, you can upgrade your account
([pricing](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/)).

**Configuration on the Centreon MAP server**

Insert the token in the file `/etc/centreon-studio/studio-config.properties`:

```text
##### GEO
mapbox.token=sk.xxxxxxxx
```

Then restart centreon-map:

```shell
systemctl restart centreon-map
```
