Centreon MBI widgets are used in Centreon [custom views](../getting-started/create-custom-view.html). This means you can now use dashboards to create real-time AND
reporting statistics (e.g., for availability, applications,
performance).

### MTBF and MTRS by service {#mbi-hgs-hc-by-service-mtbf-mtrs}

#### Description

This widget provides information on the reliability (MTBF) and
maintenability (MTRS) of your services as well as the level of your
team\'s efficiency when managing downtime (MTTA). Data is shown as a top
N aggregate statistic. Additional information such as current status,
availability, number of events or last state change are also provided to
help in decision-making.

    two failures. Services with good maintainability have a short MTRS.
-   MTTA (mean time to acknowledge) is the average duration for
    acknowledging DOWN states. The average is calculated only on
    acknowledged events.
