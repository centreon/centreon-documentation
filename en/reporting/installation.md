> [Centreon](mailto:sales@centreon.com).


Four major steps to installing Centreon MBI:

- Check the system prerequisites.
- Install the Centreon MBI interface in the Centreon application (Centreon MBI Server).
- Install the reporting server (Centreon MBI Reporting Server).
- Configure Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) in the Centreon MBI.

## Architecture

This chapter describes the Centreon MBI architecture and provides an
overview of how the extension is integrated into Centreon monitoring
software.

The information is addressed to administrators who will be installing or
configuring Centreon MBI.

### Dedicated reporting server

This architecture and prerequisites apply to:

- Test environnements
- Pre-production environments
- Production environments.

The diagram below shows the main components of Centreon MBI:

![image](../assets/reporting/installation/architecture.png)

*The monitoring database can be installed on a server other than the Centreon server.*

- **ETL**: Process that extracts, transforms and loads data into the
  reporting database.
- **CBIS**: Scheduler that manages job execution and publication.
- **Reporting database**: MariaDB database that contains reporting data
  and some raw data extracted from the monitoring database.

### Network flow table

The table below presents the different types of flow, by default,
between the dedicated BI server, Centreon server and databases:

|  **Application**  |  **Source**      |       Destination     |   Port |  Protocol |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------|-----------|
|  ETL/CBIS         | Reporting server |  Centreon Database    | 3306   | TCP       |
|  SSH              | Reporting server |  Centreon             | 22     | TCP       |
|  CBIS             | Centreon         |  Reporting server     | 1234   | TCP       |
|  CBIS             | Reporting server |  Centreon             | 80     | HTTP\*    |
|  Widgets          | Centreon         |  Reporting server     | 3306   | TCP       |


\**Only required for Host-Graph-v2 and Hostgroup-Graph-v2 reports that use Centreon API to generate graphs*

### Packages information

Centreon MBI installation requires two RPM packages:

- Centreon-bi-server: Installs the Centreon MBI interface integrated into the
  Centreon front end and must reside on the Centreon Web Server.
- Centreon-bi-reporting-server: Contains all the components needed to run the
  reporting server -- report scheduler, ETL, standards reports -- and must
  reside on a dedicated server for reporting processes.

You should install the MariaDB database at the same time. We highly recommand
installing the database on the same server for performance & isolation
considerations.

## Prerequisites

### Centreon central server

**Software**

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

## Install the extension on Centreon

The tasks explained in this chapter must be performed on the Centreon
central server.

Install the Centreon MBI repository, you can find it on the 
[support portal](https://support.centreon.com/s/repositories).

Then run the following command:

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--RHEL / CentOS / Oracle Linux 8-->
```shell
dnf install centreon-bi-server
```
<!--CentOS 7-->
```shell
yum install centreon-bi-server
```
<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

### Activate the extension

The menu `Administration > Extension > Manager` of Centreon enables you to
install the different extension detected by Centreon. Click on the **Centreon MBI** card to install it.

Upload the license sent by the Centreon team to be able to start configuring the General Options.

### Configure the general options

Set the following parameters in the General Options menu `Reporting \>
Monitoring Business Intelligence \> General Options`:

| Tab                  | Option                                           | Value                                                       |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scheduler  Options   | CBIS Host                                        | Reporting server IP Address                                 |
| ETL Options          | Reporting engine uses a dedicated MariaDB server | Yes                                                         |
| Reporting Widgets \* | Reporting MariaDB database                       | Reporting database IP Address (default = same as CBIS Host) |


\* *The connection test will not yet work at this stage of the
installation process.*

### Centreon central databases access

#### Case #1: MariaDB monitoring database is hosted on the Central monitoring server

Launch the command below to authorize the reporting server to connect to
the monitoring server databases. Use the following option:

**\@ROOTPWD@**: Root MariaDB password of the monitoring databases
server.If there is no password for \"root\" user, don\'t specify the
option **root-password**.

```shell
/usr/share/centreon/www/modules/centreon-bi-server/tools/centreonMysqlRights.pl --root-password=@ROOTPWD@
```

#### Case #2: MariaDB monitoring database is hosted on a dedicated server

Connect by SSH to the database server, and the run the following commands:

```SQL
CREATE USER 'centreonbi'@'$BI_ENGINE_IP$' IDENTIFIED BY 'centreonbi';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON centreon.* TO 'centreonbi'@'$BI_ENGINE_IP$';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON centreon_storage.* TO 'centreonbi'@'$BI_ENGINE_IP$';
```

**$BI_ENGINE_IP$**: IP address of the reporting server.

> If you\'re using MariaDB replication for your **monitoring databases**,
> certain views are created during installation of Centreon MBI. You need
> to exclude them from replication by adding the following line in the
> my.cnf file of the slave server.
> ```shell
> replicate-wild-ignore-table=centreon.mod_bi_%v01,centreon.mod_bi_%V01
> ```
> Then, create the views manually on the slave server by launching the
> following command line:
>
> #mysql centreon < [view_creation.sql](../assets/reporting/installation/view_creation.sql)


Please go to the next chapter to continue the installation.

## Install the dedicated reporting server

### Install the packages

You need the following information available before proceeding with the
installation process:

- IP/DNS of the monitoring database
- IP/DNS of the Centreon web interface
- IP/DNS of the reporting database (localhost highly recommanded)
- Access (user/password) to the reporting database
- Knowledge of the SSH password (after defining it) for the Centreon
  BI user on the central monitoring server (to publish reports on the
  interface).

To start installing the reporting server, install the MBI repository, you can find it on the 
[support portal](https://support.centreon.com/s/repositories).

Then execute the following command:

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--RHEL / CentOS / Oracle Linux 8-->
```shell
dnf install centreon-bi-reporting-server MariaDB-server MariaDB-client
```

If you installed your reporting server using a fresh distribution you
need to add the following GPG key:

```shell
cd /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/
wget http://yum.centreon.com/standard/21.04/el8/stable/RPM-GPG-KEY-CES
```
<!--CentOS 7-->
```shell
yum install centreon-bi-reporting-server MariaDB-server MariaDB-client
```

If you installed your reporting server using a fresh distribution you
need to add the following GPG key:

```shell
cd /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/
wget http://yum.centreon.com/standard/21.04/el7/stable/RPM-GPG-KEY-CES
```
<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

### Reporting server configuration

#### MariaDB optimization

Make sure you have installed the MariaDB configuration file provided in
the pre-requisites before starting the MariaDB service [following file](../assets/reporting/installation/centreon.cnf)

```shell
systemctl restart mariadb
```

For installation, it is necessary to modify **LimitNOFILE** limitation.
Setting this option in /etc/my.cnf will NOT work.

```shell
mkdir -p  /etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/
echo -ne "[Service]\nLimitNOFILE=32000\n" | tee /etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/limits.conf
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart mariadb
```

Then start the service MariaDB. If this service cannot start, remove the
ib_log files before restarting MariaDB (be sure MariaDB is stopped):

```shell
rm -f /var/lib/mysql/ib_logfile*
systemctl start mariadb
```

If you are using a custom MariaDB socket file, modify the `/etc/my.cnf` file
and in the [client] section, add the following variable:

```shell
socket=$PATH_TO_SOCKET$
```

### Start configuring

First check that the reporting MariaDB is running. Then launch the
following command, answering the questions:

```shell
/usr/share/centreon-bi/config/install.sh
```

The script handles the SSH exchange key between the monitoring and
reporting servers and configures the default SFTP publication rule in
order to publish reports on the Centreon web interface. Finally, it
activates the backup and starts the CBIS service.

Once installation is complete, go to the next chapter to configure the ETL.

### ETL: Configuration

Centreon MBI integrates its own extract, transform, load (ETL)
capabilities to:

- Synchronize raw monitoring data with the reporting server.
- Calculate availability and performance statistics on the reporting
  server.
- Manage data retention on the reporting server.

Before following the next steps, you should have read
[the best practice parts](installation.html#best-practices-for-monitoring) to
ensure that the Centreon objects (e.g., groups and categories) are configured
according to Centreon MBI requirements.

In the *Reporting > Business Intelligence > General Options > ETL options* menu
of the Centreon server, specify the following options:


| **Options**                                                                            | **Values**                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

**(1)** Reports requiring a precise value per hour of performance data
are listed below. If you do not use the following reports, disable the
statistics calculation per hour:

- Hostgroup-Host-details-1
- Host-detail-v2
- Hostgroup-traffic-Average-Usage-By-Interface
- Hostgroup-traffic-by-Interface-And-Bandwith-Ranges.

### ETL: Data retention

The reporting server contains statistics tables specific to Centreon MBI
in the database "centreon_storage". The storage space used by these
tables increases every day. It is possible to control the size of these
tables by setting data retention rules.

Under *Reporting > Monitoring Business Intelligence > General options > Data retention*,
data retention can be managed by:

- Type of data (availability, performance).
- Precision of data (raw data, hourly, daily or monthly values).

> Before enabling the data retention options, check that the **Reporting
> engine uses a dedicated MariaDB server** option is correctly set to
> "Yes" in the *Reporting > Business Intelligence > General options ETL options* menu.

Enable data retention management by selecting \"Yes\", then set the
options in the configuration (example below).

![image](../assets/reporting/installation/bi_retention.png)

To activate automatic purge of old data, edit the cron file
`/etc/cron.d/centreon-bi-purge` on the reporting server, then uncomment the following line:

```shell
#0 20 * * * root @CENTREON_BI_HOME@/*etl*/dataRetentionManager.pl >> @CENTREON_BI_LOG@/dataRetentionManager.log 2>&1
```

Avoid periods scheduled for statistical calculations with Centreon MBI
ETL and report generations.

You can run this cron daily or weekly, depending on the execution time of the batch and the load generated on the server.

Then restart the service cron:

```shell
systemctl restart crond
```

**BEST PRACTICE**: Select different retention periods according to the
granularity of the statistical data:

- Hourly aggregated values are used to analyze a metric over a short period, they take a
  lot of space on the disk. You may not need to keep these statistics more that two or three months.
- Beyond five or six months, you may only need to view the trend for
  availability or performance statistics. You could then keep the
  daily aggregated data for a maximum of six months, for example, and
  configure the retention of monthly aggregated data for a period of
  several dozen months.

Please go to the next chapter to continue the installation.

### ETL: Execution

> Before continuing, be sure that you have installed the MariaDB
> configuration file as specified above in the prerequisites. Configure
> and activate data retention so that only the required data is imported
> and calculated.

#### Rebuilding statistics using historical data

Run the following command on the *REPORTING* server, it will:

- Delete all existing data from the reporting server.
- Import raw monitoring data from the monitoring server to the
  reporting server (based on retention parameters).
- Populate the tables containing the availability statistics for hosts
  and services.
- Populate the tables containing the performance and capacity
  statistics.

```shell
/usr/share/centreon-bi/bin/centreonBIETL -r
```

#### Activating daily execution (of the script)

Once the rebuild process is finished, you can activate the daily
statistic calculation. On the reporting server, edit the file
*/etc/cron.d/centreon-bi-engine* and uncomment the following line:

```shell
#30 4 * * * root /usr/share/centreon-bi/bin/centreonBIETL -d >> /var/log/centreon-bi/centreonBIETL.log 2>&1
```

Restart the service cron:

```shell
systemctl restart crond
```

> Make sure that the batch *centreonBIETL* starts only once the batch
> *eventReportBuilder* has finished on the monitoring server (see the cron
> file \* /etc/cron.d/centreon\* on the monitoring server).

Centreon MBI installation is now complete, check [the tutorial](../getting-started/analyze-resources-availability.html)
