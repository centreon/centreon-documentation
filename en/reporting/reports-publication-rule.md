Reports publication rules {#publication_rules}
=========================

The menu \"Reporting \> Business Intelligence \> Publication rules\"
allows you to publish the reports generated by CBIS on different
platforms using different protocols.

In order to publish all the generated reports on the monitoring server,
a default rule must be defined using SFTP.

On the monitoring server
------------------------

A system user \"centreonBI\" user has been created. Set a password for
this user for future SSH communications between the two servers:

    passwd centreonBI

On the reporting server
-----------------------

Generate SSH keys for the system user \"centreonBI\" in order to avoid
using password when CBIS will copy the generated reports onto the
monitoring server.:

    su - centreonBI
    ssh-keygen
      Enter file in which to save the key (/home/centreonBI/.ssh/id_rsa):
      > Created directory '/usr/local/centreon-bi/.ssh'.
      > Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
      > Enter same passphrase again:
      > Your identification has been saved in /home/centreonBI/.ssh/id_rsa.

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

At the \"Enter passphrase\" request, confirm without entering a
passphrase.
:::

Transfer the key to the **Centreon** server. The **centreonBI** user
must be configured with a password on the monitoring server):

    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub centreonBI@{MONITORING_IP_ADDRESS}

Test the SSH connection from the reporting server:

    ssh centreonBI@{MONITORING_IP_ADDRESS}

You should be able to connect without entering any password.

On the interface Centreon
-------------------------

In the \"Reporting \> Business Intelligence \> Publication rules\" of
Centreon, edit the \"default\" publication rule and specify the
