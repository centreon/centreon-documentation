## Setup your first platform

To setup your first Centreon platform, we suggest you to use a ready-to-use virtual machine.

**Prerequisites**

Those virtual machines are available in OVA format for VMware environment and OVF for Oracle VirtualBox tool. Those are based on **Linux CentOS 7** operating system including a Centreon installation allowing to easily start your first monitoring.

The virtual machine needs:

- Processor: any recent Intel or AMD processor with at least 2 vCPUs should be enough.
- Memory: depending on your operating system, you will need at least 1 GB of RAM. To fully enjoy Centreon's experience, you need at least 2 GB of free memory.
- Hard Disk storage: The virtual machine requires at least 6.5 GB of free space on your hard disk. However, if you want keep using Centreon, it is recommended to have at least 10 GB as its size will grow over time.
- An Internet access to benefit from the IT-100 free offer.

> For a more custom installation, the complete prerequisites are available [here](../installation/prerequisites.html).

### Download

You can install Centreon:

- [Using Centreon ISO](../installation/installation-of-a-central-server/using-centreon-iso.html)
- From ready-to-use virtual machines:

The virtual machines are available on the [Centreon download web site](https://download.centreon.com).

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

<!--VMware environment-->
\
Go to to **File > Deploy OVF Template** and select the **OVA file**. Since the menu selections are actually linked to
your specific VMWare configuration, we are unable to provide more information. Be advised that best practice is to use
the **Thin Provision** option to save as much free space as possible on the disk.

<!--Oracle Virtualbox-->
\
Extract the contents of the archive and double-click on the **OVF file**. Follow the instructions to import the virtual
machine.

<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

Once your virtual machine is imported, you will need to **add a network card**. Edit the settings of the virtual machine and
a network card. Select the correct associated network to access to Internet.

The virtual machine can now be started.

#### First boot

Once your virtual machine has started. You must connect to it via a shell terminal and perform the requested operations.

> It is imperative that you complete the instructions, especially operations 4 and 5.

Once those operations have been carried out, you can delete this message by deleting the /etc/profile.d/centreon.sh file.

#### Default credentials

- The default Centreon web interface account is: **admin / centreon**.
- The server administration account (through SSH) is: **root / centreon**.
- The root password of the DBMS is not initialized.

> For security reasons, we highly recommend you to change those passwords after the installation completed.

You can now move to the *First login* section.

## Basic principle of monitoring

Before starting to monitor, let's take a look at some basic concepts:

* A **host** is any device that has an IP address and that one wishes to monitor. For example, a physical server, a
  virtual machine, a temperature probe, an IP camera, a printer or a storage space.
* A **service** is a check point, or indicator, to be monitored on a host. This can be the CPU usage rate, temperature,
  motion detection, bandwidth usage rate, disk I/O, and so on.
* In order to collect each indicator value, monitoring **plugins** are used which are periodically executed by a
  collection engine called Centreon Engine.
* To be executed, a plugin needs a set of arguments that define, for example, which host to connect to or through which protocol.
  The plugin and its associated arguments form a **command**.

For example, to monitor a host with Centreon is to configure all the commands needed to measure the desired indicators,
and then deploy that configuration to the collection engine so that these commands are run periodically.

Nevertheless, to drastically simplify the configuration, we will rely on monitoring templates:

* A **host template** defines the configuration of the indicators for a given type of equipment.
* It relies on **service templates** that define the configuration of the commands needed to collect these indicators.
* Centreon provides downloadable **Plugins Packs** to install on its monitoring platform: each Plugin Pack includes host
  and services templates to configure the monitoring of a particular device in a few clicks.

This quick start guide proposes to install the monitoring templates supplied free of charge with the Centreon solution
and then to implement them to monitor your first equipment.

![image](../assets/getting-started/host_service_command.png)

> To go further with templates, please read the [templates chapter](../monitoring/templates.html#definition).

### Installation of basic monitoring templates

Go to the **Configuration \> Plugin Packs** menu.

> [Configure the proxy](../administration/parameters/centreon-ui.html#proxy-configuration) to allow the Centreon server to access the Internet.

Install the **Base Generic** Plugin Pack by moving your cursor on it and by clicking on **+** icon (it is a prerequisite
to the installation of any other Plugin Packs):

![image](../assets/getting-started/pp_base_generic_1.png)

You can also click on the Plugin Pack in order to know its content before installing it:

![image](../assets/getting-started/pp_base_generic_2.png)

Install other Plugin Packs you probably need for your environment, for example **Linux SNMP** and **Windows SNMP** available
for free:

![image](../assets/getting-started/pp_install_basic.gif)

Now you have the basic templates and plugins to initial monitoring!
