title: Which installation should I choose?

There are several ways to install Centreon. Which one suits your needs best?

* Using the [Centreon ISO](../installation/installation-of-a-central-server/using-centreon-iso.html): if you want to install both the OS (CentOS 7) and Centreon.

* Using [RPM packages](../installation/installation-of-a-central-server/using-packages.html): if you already have the OS and you only want to install Centreon. The following operating systems are supported: CentOS/RedHat/OracleLinux 7 or 8. 
    >Due to RedHat's stance on CentOS 8, we suggest not to use said version for your production environment. Nevertheless, the packages for CentOS 8 are compatible with the RHEL 8 and Oracle Linux 8 versions.

* Using a [ready-to-use virtual machine](../installation/installation-of-a-central-server/using-virtual-machines.html): for a quick installation, typically for testing purposes. It is not recommended to use this type of installation in production.

* Using [sources](../installation/installation-of-a-central-server/using-sources.html): if you want to install your Centreon on a Linux
distribution that is not supported by Centreon. Please note that the [IT Edition and Business Edition modules](https://www.centreon.com/editions/) do not work with unsupported distributions yet.
