* **Home** shows [custom views](create-custom-view.html).
  Your workspace may be blank for now. Once you configure customizable widgets, you will see data and charts according
  to your customization.
* **Monitoring** provides a combined view of the statuses of all monitored items in real and delayed time using logs and
  performance graphics.
* **Reporting** provides an intuitive view (using diagrams) of the evolution of monitoring over a given time period.
* **Configuration** allows you to configure all monitored items and the monitoring infrastructure.
* **Administration** allows you to configure the Centreon platform (with settings such as authentication, proxy, extensions ...) and view the overall status of the servers.
